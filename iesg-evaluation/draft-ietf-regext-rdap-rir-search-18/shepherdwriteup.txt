# Document Shepherd Write-Up for Group Documents

*This version is dated 4 July 2022.*

Thank you for your service as a document shepherd. Among the responsibilities is
answering the questions in this write-up to give helpful context to Last Call
and Internet Engineering Steering Group ([IESG][1]) reviewers, and your
diligence in completing it is appreciated. The full role of the shepherd is
further described in [<a href="/doc/rfc4858/">RFC 4858</a>][2]. You will need the cooperation of the authors
and editors to complete these checks.

Note that some numbered items contain multiple related questions; please be sure
to answer all of them.

## Document History

1. Does the working group (WG) consensus represent the strong concurrence of a
few individuals, with others being silent, or did it reach broad agreement?

The document reached consensus among both RIR and DNR actors despite the
latter are not directly involved in its implementation.

2. Was there controversy about particular points, or were there decisions where
the consensus was particularly rough?

One WG member raised a concern about the usage of bare identifiers along
with the definition of many extension identifiers in this draft. Despite
that bare identifiers as path segments and JSON response members seem to be
unrecommended by RFCs 9082 and 9083 respectively, they have been used in
RFCs 9536 and 9537 and are unlikely to cause collisions or other problems in
practice. It must further be noted that the WG appear to be converging on a
document (i.e. <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-regext-rdap-extensions/">draft-ietf-regext-rdap-extensions</a>) that clarifies the
normative language about the definition of extensions and allows for the
bare extension identifiers. With regard to the multiplicity of extension
identifiers defined by this spec, the option of prefixing them with a unique
extension identifier may result in generating query and response features
that could be confusing for users who would instead expect consistency with
path segments and core object types described in existing RFCs.

Anyway, the document was very appreciated at first submission and everyone
has always cooperated with the authors to improve the document in all
respect.

3. Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If
so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the
responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this
questionnaire is publicly available.)

No.

4. For protocol documents, are there existing implementations of the contents of
the document? Have a significant number of potential implementers indicated
plans to implement? Are any existing implementations reported somewhere,
either in the document itself (as [<a href="/doc/rfc7942/">RFC 7942</a>][3] recommends) or elsewhere
(where)?

APNIC has made a proof-of-concept implementation including all the features
described in this specification and ARIN is expected to do likewise soon.
RIPE have already deployed part of this functionality in their production
RDAP service. It must be said that, if the number of implementers on server
side is not comparable with RDAP servers' implementers in the domain name
space, it will surely be very large on client side as RIRs provide services
for a lot of users.

## Additional Reviews

5. Do the contents of this document closely interact with technologies in other
IETF working groups or external organizations, and would it therefore benefit
from their review? Have those reviews occurred? If yes, describe which
reviews took place.

No content of this document could benefit from a review by another IETF
working group.

6. Describe how the document meets any required formal expert review criteria,
such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.

There were no formal expert reviews sought or conducted for this document.

7. If the document contains a YANG module, has the final version of the module
been checked with any of the [recommended validation tools][4] for syntax and
formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is
the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module
comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified
in [<a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC 8342</a>][5]?

This document doesn't contain a YANG module.

8. Describe reviews and automated checks performed to validate sections of the
final version of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code,
BNF rules, MIB definitions, CBOR's CDDL, etc.

RegExt members and authors have leveraged existing tools to validate both
the JSON examples and the JSONPath expressions of this document.

## Document Shepherd Checks

9. Based on the shepherd's review of the document, is it their opinion that this
document is needed, clearly written, complete, correctly designed, and ready
to be handed off to the responsible Area Director?

Yes, it is. It first extends to RIRs the RDAP searches defined by <a href="/doc/rfc9082/">RFC 9082</a>
for DNRs. Secondly, it defines new searches based on relation between RIR
objects and extends the reverse search feature described in <a href="/doc/rfc9536/">RFC 9536</a> to the
RIR context. Everything is well designed and comprehensively explained.

10. Several IETF Areas have assembled [lists of common issues that their
reviewers encounter][6]. For which areas have such issues been identified
and addressed? For which does this still need to happen in subsequent
reviews?

None of the aforementioned issues seems to be relevant to this document.

11. What type of RFC publication is being requested on the IETF stream ([Best
Current Practice][12], [Proposed Standard, Internet Standard][13],
[Informational, Experimental or Historic][14])? Why is this the proper type
of RFC? Do all Datatracker state attributes correctly reflect this intent?

This document is typed "Standards Track" as it defines RIR-related
extensions to both request and response in RDAP. The document is properly
listed in Datatracker.

12. Have reasonable efforts been made to remind all authors of the intellectual
property rights (IPR) disclosure obligations described in [<a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a>][7]? To
the best of your knowledge, have all required disclosures been filed? If
not, explain why. If yes, summarize any relevant discussion, including links
to publicly-available messages when applicable.

Both the authors have confirmed that there are no IPR disclosure
obligations needed for this document.

13. Has each author, editor, and contributor shown their willingness to be
listed as such? If the total number of authors and editors on the front page
is greater than five, please provide a justification.

Both the authors have agreed to be listed as an author.

14. Document any remaining I-D nits in this document. Simply running the [idnits
tool][8] is not enough; please review the ["Content Guidelines" on
<a href="http://authors.ietf.org">authors.ietf.org</a>][15]. (Also note that the current idnits tool generates
some incorrect warnings; a rewrite is underway.)

Apart from 5 instances of too long lines that can be easily fixed before
the final publishing, all the other I-D nits found are false positives.

15. Should any informative references be normative or vice-versa? See the [IESG
Statement on Normative and Informative References][16].

No.

16. List any normative references that are not freely available to anyone. Did
the community have sufficient access to review any such normative
references?

All normative references are IETF documents.

17. Are there any normative downward references (see [<a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>][9] and [<a href="/doc/bcp97/">BCP
97</a>][10]) that are not already listed in the [DOWNREF registry][17]? If so,
list them.

No.

18. Are there normative references to documents that are not ready to be
submitted to the IESG for publication or are otherwise in an unclear state?
If so, what is the plan for their completion?

No, there aren't.

19. Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? If
so, does the Datatracker metadata correctly reflect this and are those RFCs
listed on the title page, in the abstract, and discussed in the
introduction? If not, explain why and point to the part of the document
where the relationship of this document to these other RFCs is discussed.

No.

20. Describe the document shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section,
especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document.
Confirm that all aspects of the document requiring IANA assignments are
associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm
that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm
that each newly created IANA registry specifies its initial contents,
allocations procedures, and a reasonable name (see [<a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>][11]).

This document updates the existing IANA RDAP Extensions Registry by adding
5 new extensions idenfifiers and the Link Relations Registry by adding 5
new link relations. It also updates two IANA registries defined by <a href="/doc/rfc9536/">RFC9536</a>.
The RDAP Reverse Search Registry is updated by adding 4 entries which allow
to use for the the resource types ips and autnums the reverse search
properties already registered for the standard searchable resource types
(i.e. domains, nameservers, entities) and the entity related resource type.
The RDAP Reverse Search Mapping Registry is updated as well by adding 4
entries related to those to be added to the RDAP Reverse Search Registry.
In conclusion, the IANA considerations are consistent with the technical
details of the document.

21. List any new IANA registries that require Designated Expert Review for
future allocations. Are the instructions to the Designated Expert clear?
Please include suggestions of designated experts, if appropriate.

There are no new IANA registries, only new entries of registries already
defined.
