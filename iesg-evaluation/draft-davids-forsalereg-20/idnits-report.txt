7	     The "_for-sale" Underscored and Globally Scoped DNS Node Name
8	                       draft-davids-forsalereg-20

10	Abstract

12	   This document defines an operational convention that uses the
13	   reserved underscored DNS leaf node name "_for-sale" to indicate the
14	   parent domain name is available for purchase.

16	   The convention can be deployed without disrupting existing
17	   operations, and it may be applied even when the domain name is still
18	   actively in use.

100	1.  Introduction

102	   Well-established services [RFC3912][RFC9083] exist for determining
103	   whether a DNS domain name is registered.  However, the existence of a
104	   domain name does not necessarily imply that it cannot be obtained; it
105	   may still be available for sale.

107	   Some registrars and other parties offer brokerage services between
108	   domain name holders and interested buyers.  Such services are of
109	   limited value when the domain name is not available for purchase, but
110	   they may be beneficial for domain names that are explicitly marked as
111	   for sale.

113	   This document defines a simple method to explicitly signal that a
114	   domain name, although registered, is available for purchase.  It
115	   enables a domain name holder to add a reserved underscored leaf node
116	   name [RFC8552] in the zone, indicating that the domain name is for
117	   sale.  The indicator can be turned on and off at will and, moreover,
118	   it is immediately deployable and does not require significant changes
119	   in existing services, allowing for a smooth introduction of the
120	   concept.

122	   The TXT RR type [RFC1035] created for this purpose must follow the
123	   formal definition of Section 2.  Its content may contain a pointer,
124	   such as a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) [RFC3986], an
125	   Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI) [RFC3987] or another
126	   string, allowing interested parties to obtain information or contact
127	   the domain name holder for further negotiations.  Details about
128	   whether and how such negotiations occur are out of scope.

130	   With due caution, such information can also be incorporated into
131	   automated availability services.  When checking a domain name for
132	   purchasability, the service may indicate whether it is for sale and
133	   provide a pointer to the seller's information.

135	   The TXT content defined by this document is intended primarily for
136	   human-readable informational display, rather than for algorithmic
137	   string comparison or automated processing.

139	   The operational convention described in this document does not
140	   require any protocol change.

142	   Examples are provided in Appendix A.

144	1.1.  Terminology

146	   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
147	   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
148	   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
149	   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
150	   capitals, as shown here.

152	   Although the document defines an operational convention rather than a
153	   protocol extension, normative language is used to promote consistent
154	   and unambiguous behaviours among entities that adopt the convention.

156	   The term "processor" refers to an entity (person, system, or service)
157	   that reads, interprets, and takes appropriate actions based on "_for-
158	   sale" DNS labels, whether manually or automatically.

160	   The term "for sale" is used in a broad sense and may also refer to
161	   cases where the domain name is available for lease, or where the
162	   contractual right to use the domain name is offered to another party.

164	   DNS terminology in this document follows [RFC9499].

166	2.  Conventions

168	2.1.  General Record Format

170	   Each "_for-sale" TXT record MUST begin with a version tag, optionally
171	   followed by a string containing content that follows a simple
172	   "tag=value" syntax.

174	   The formal definition of the record format, using ABNF
175	   [RFC5234][RFC7405], is as follows:

177	   forsale-record  = forsale-version [forsale-content]
178	                     ; referred to as 'content' or RDATA
179	                     ; in a single character-string

181	   forsale-version = %s"v=FORSALE1;"
182	                     ; %x76.3D.46.4F.52.53.41.4C.45.31.3B
183	                     ; version tag, case-sensitive, no spaces

185	   forsale-content = fcod-pair / ftxt-pair / furi-pair / fval-pair
186	                     ; referred to as 'tag-value pairs'
187	                     ; only one tag-value pair per record

189	   fcod-pair       = fcod-tag fcod-value
190	   ftxt-pair       = ftxt-tag ftxt-value
191	   furi-pair       = furi-tag furi-value
192	   fval-pair       = fval-tag fval-value
193	                     ; the tags are referred to as 'content tags'
194	                     ; the values are referred to as 'content values'

196	   fcod-tag        = %s"fcod="
197	   ftxt-tag        = %s"ftxt="
198	   furi-tag        = %s"furi="
199	   fval-tag        = %s"fval="
200	                     ; all content tags case-sensitive lowercase

202	   fcod-value      = 1*239OCTET

204	   ftxt-value      = 1*239OCTET

206	   furi-value      = URI / IRI
207	                     ; http, https, mailto and tel URI schemes
208	                     ; exactly one URI or IRI

210	   URI             = <as defined in RFC3986, Appendix A>
211	   IRI             = <as defined in RFC3987, Section 2.2>

213	   fval-value      = fval-currency fval-amount
214	                     ; total length: 2 to 239 characters
215	   fval-currency   = 1*%x41-5A
216	                     ; one or more uppercase letters (A-Z)
217	                     ; indicating (crypto)currency
218	                     ; e.g., USD, EUR, BTC, ETH
219	                     ; standard three-letter fiat currencies recommended
220	   fval-amount     = int-part [ %x2E frac-part ]
221	                     ; integer part with optional fractional part
222	                     ; e.g., 0.00010
223	   int-part        = 1*DIGIT
224	   frac-part       = 1*DIGIT

226	   See Section 2.2 for more detailed format definitions per content tag
227	   type.

229	   Each "_for-sale" TXT record MUST NOT contain more than one tag-value
230	   pair, but multiple TXT records MAY be present in a single RRset.

232	   Every tag-value pair in the RRset MUST be unique, but multiple
233	   instances of the same content tag MAY occur within a single RRset
234	   (e.g., two "fcod=" content tags, each with a different content
235	   value).

237	   See Section 2.4 for additional RRset limitations.

239	   The OPTIONAL forsale-content provides information to interested
240	   parties as explained in Section 1.

242	   If the forsale-content is absent or invalid, but a valid version tag
243	   is present, processors SHOULD assume that the domain is for sale
244	   unless a local policy indicates otherwise.  For example:

246	   _for-sale.example.com. IN TXT "v=FORSALE1;"
247	   _for-sale.example.com. IN TXT "v=FORSALE1;fcod="
248	   _for-sale.example.com. IN TXT "v=FORSALE1;foo=bar"

250	   In such cases, processors determine how to proceed.  An approach
251	   might be to signal that the domain is for sale and to rely on
252	   conventional mechanisms (e.g., WHOIS or Registration Data Access
253	   Protocol (RDAP)) to retrieve and present contact information.

255	   TXT records in the same RRset that lack a version tag MUST NOT be
256	   interpreted as a valid "_for-sale" indicator.  However, they may
257	   still offer some additional information for humans when considered
258	   alongside a valid record.  For example:

260	   _for-sale.example.com. IN TXT "I am for sale"
261	   _for-sale.example.com. IN TXT "v=FORSALE1;fcod=XX-NGYyYjEyZWY"

263	   If no TXT records at a "_for-sale" leaf node name contain a valid
264	   version tag, processors MUST consider the node name invalid and MUST
265	   ignore it.

267	   See Section 2.3 for additional content limitations.

269	2.2.  Content Tag Type Definitions

271	   The following content tags are defined as valid content tags.

273	   Content tags are optional.  Providing at least one to give interested
274	   parties a pointer for engagement is RECOMMENDED.

276	2.2.1.  fcod

278	   This content tag is intended to contain a code that is meaningful
279	   only to processors that understand its semantics.  The content value
280	   MUST consist of at least one octet.

282	   The manner in which the "fcod=" content tag is used is determined by
283	   agreement between cooperating parties.

285	   For example, a domain name registry may allow registrars to enter a
286	   "for sale" URL into their back-end system.  From that URL, a unique
287	   code is generated.  This code is inserted as the value of the "fcod="
288	   content tag of the "_for-sale" TXT record of a domain name, as shown
289	   in the example below.

291	   When a user checks the availability of the domain name using a
292	   registry-provided tool (e.g., a web interface), the domain name
293	   registry may use the code to redirect the user to the appropriate
294	   "for sale" URL, which may include a query component containing the
295	   domain name, for example:

297	   https://forsale-url.example.com/exco?d=example.org

299	   The rationale for this approach is that controlling parties retain
300	   authority over redirection URLs and any other information derived
301	   from the content tag, thereby preventing users from being sent to
302	   unintended or malicious destinations or from being presented with
303	   unintended content.  This approach also allows the interpretation of
304	   "fcod=" content values to be adjusted centrally in back-end systems,
305	   such as determining which "for sale" URL to redirect to, without
306	   modifying the "_for-sale" TXT records.

308	   The following example shows a string encoded using Base64 [RFC4648]
309	   preceded by the prefix "EXCO-" as the value of the content tag:

311	   _for-sale IN TXT "v=FORSALE1;fcod=EXCO-S2lscm95IHdhcyBoZXJl"

313	   See the Additional Examples section for other possible uses of this
314	   content tag.

316	   Note: As an implementation consideration, when multiple parties are
317	   involved in the domain sale process and use the same mechanism, it
318	   may be difficult to identify the relevant content in an RRset.
319	   Adding a recognisable prefix to the content (e.g., "EXCO-") is one
320	   possible approach.  However, this is left to the implementor, as it
321	   is not enforced in this document.  In this case, Example Corporation
322	   (ExCo) would recognise its content tag and interpret it as intended.
323	   This example uses Base64 encoding to avoid escaping and ensure
324	   printable characters, though this is OPTIONAL and not required.

326	2.2.2.  ftxt

328	   This content tag is intended to contain concise, human-readable text
329	   that conveys additional information to interested parties.  For
330	   example:

332	   _for-sale IN TXT "v=FORSALE1;ftxt=Call for info."
333	   While a single octet is the minimum, it is RECOMMENDED to provide
334	   more context.

336	   While a URI in this field is not syntactically prohibited, its
337	   interpretation as a URI is not guaranteed.  Use of URIs in this field
338	   SHOULD be avoided in favour of the "furi=" content tag.

340	   See Section 2.2.4 for a way to explicitly indicate an asking price
341	   for easier machine parsing.

343	   See Section 3.2 for considerations regarding the representation of
344	   non-ASCII data in the content value.

346	2.2.3.  furi

348	   This content tag is intended to contain a human-readable and machine-
349	   parsable URI that can be used by interested parties to retrieve
350	   further information.

352	   While the syntax allows any URI scheme, only the following schemes
353	   are RECOMMENDED for use: http and https [RFC9110], mailto
354	   [RFC6068][RFC6530] (Section 11.1), and tel [RFC3966].

356	   The content value MUST contain exactly one URI.  For example:

358	   _for-sale IN TXT "v=FORSALE1;furi=https://example.com/foo%20bar"

360	   URIs MUST conform to the syntax and encoding requirements specified
361	   in Section 2.1 of [RFC3986], including the percent-encoding of
362	   characters not allowed unencoded (e.g., spaces must be encoded as %20
363	   in a URI).

365	   Section 3.2 provides additional guidelines on character encoding.

367	   See the Security Considerations section for possible risks.

369	   Note: References to a URI in this document also encompass IRIs
370	   [RFC3987].

372	2.2.4.  fval

374	   This content tag is intended to contain human-readable and machine-
375	   parsable text that explicitly indicates an asking price in a certain
376	   currency.

378	   Price information is commonly published by domain sellers.  The
379	   "fval=" content tag provides a structured format for this purpose,
380	   enabling reliable machine parsing and reducing ambiguity compared to
381	   embedding prices in free-form "ftxt=" content tags.  For example:

383	   _for-sale IN TXT "v=FORSALE1;fval=EUR999"

385	   The information provided in "fval=" is not binding and is intended
386	   for indicative purposes only.  Current and reliable information can
387	   be obtained by engaging directly via "furi=" or other available
388	   communication mechanisms.

390	   See Section 3.3 for additional operational guidelines and the
391	   Security Considerations section for possible risks.

393	2.2.5.  Future Tags

395	   Future tags may be defined to accommodate operational needs.  Future
396	   content tags MUST NOT alter the semantics of existing content tags.

398	   A tag name length of 4 characters is RECOMMENDED for consistency with
399	   the initial tag set and to maintain compact record formats.

401	2.3.  Content Limitations

403	   The "_for-sale" TXT record [RFC8553] (Section 2.1) MUST contain
404	   content deemed valid under the operational convention defined in this
405	   document.

407	   The "_for-sale" indicator is only to be used for domain names that
408	   are available for purchase.  Any text suggesting that a domain is not
409	   for sale is invalid content.  When a domain name is no longer for
410	   sale, the "_for-sale" indicator is to be removed.

412	   The existence of a "_for-sale" leaf node name does not obligate the
413	   holder to sell the domain name; it may have been published in error,
414	   or withdrawn later for other reasons.

416	   This document does not dictate the exact use of any content values in
417	   the "_for-sale" TXT record.  Parties may use it in their tools,
418	   perhaps even by defining specific requirements that the content value
419	   must meet.  Content values can also be represented in a human-
420	   readable format for individuals to interpret.  See the Additional
421	   Examples section for clarification.

423	   See Section 3 for additional guidelines.

425	2.4.  RRset Limitations

427	   This document does not impose a limit on the number of TXT records in
428	   the RRset of "_for-sale" TXT records.

430	   When multiple "_for-sale" TXT records are present in an RRset, the
431	   processor MAY select one or more of them.

433	   For example, a domain name registry might extract content from an
434	   RRset that includes a recognisable "fcod=" content tag and use it to
435	   direct visitors to a sales page as part of its services.  An
436	   individual, on the other hand, might extract a phone number (if
437	   present) from a "furi=" tag in the same RRset and use it to contact a
438	   potential seller.

440	   An example of such a combined record is provided in Appendix A.5.

442	   The RDATA [RFC9499] of each "_for-sale" TXT record MUST consist of a
443	   single character-string [RFC1035] with a maximum length of 255
444	   octets, to avoid the need to concatenate multiple character-strings
445	   during processing.

447	   The following example illustrates an invalid "_for-sale" TXT record
448	   due to the presence of multiple character-strings:

450	   _for-sale IN TXT "v=FORSALE1;" "ftxt=foo" "bar" "invalid"

452	2.5.  Wildcard Limitation

454	   Wildcards are only interpreted as leaf names, so "_for-
455	   sale.*.example." is not a valid wildcard [RFC4592] and is non-
456	   conformant.  Hence, it is not possible to put all domains under a TLD
457	   for sale with just one "_for-sale" TXT record.

459	   The example below, however, shows a common use case where a "_for-
460	   sale" leaf node name exists alongside a wildcard:

462	   *         IN A    198.51.100.80
463	             IN AAAA 2001:db8::80
464	   _for-sale IN TXT  "v=FORSALE1;ftxt=Only $99 at ExCo"

466	2.6.  Placement of the Leaf Node Name

468	   The "_for-sale" leaf node name can be placed at any level of the DNS
469	   except in the .arpa infrastructure TLD.

471	   Table 1 illustrates this:

496	                    Table 1: Placements of TXT record

498	   Note 1: When the "_for-sale" leaf node name is applied to a label
499	   under a subdomain, there may not be a public domain name registry
500	   [RFC9499] capable of properly recording the rights associated with
501	   that label.  Nevertheless, this does not constitute a violation of
502	   this document.  One possible approach is for the involved parties to
503	   establish a mutual agreement to formalise these rights.

505	   Note 2: If a "_for-sale" leaf node name were to appear under the
506	   .arpa infrastructure top-level domain, it might be interpreted as an
507	   offer to sell IP address space, E.164 numbers or the like.  However,
508	   such use is explicitly out of scope for this document, and processors
509	   MUST ignore any such records.

511	   The operational convention in this document is designed for the
512	   global DNS.  Application to Special-Use Domain Names [RFC6761] (e.g.,
513	   .onion, .alt) is out of scope.

515	3.  Operational Considerations
516	3.1.  DNS Wildcards

518	   DNS wildcards interact poorly with underscored names [RFC8552]
519	   (Section 1.4), but they may still be encountered in practice,
520	   especially with operators who are not implementing this mechanism.
521	   This is why the version tag is a mandatory element: it allows
522	   processors to distinguish valid "_for-sale" records from unrelated
523	   TXT records.

525	   Nonetheless, any assumptions about the content of "_for-sale" TXT
526	   records should be made with caution, particularly in edge cases where
527	   wildcard expansion - possibly combined with DNS aliases (e.g.,
528	   CNAMEs) or redirections (e.g., DNAMEs [RFC6672]) - might result in
529	   misleading listings or unintended references to third-party domains.

531	3.2.  Handling of RDATA

533	   Since this method relies on DNS TXT records, standard content rules
534	   apply as defined in [RFC1035] (Section 3.3.14).  This includes the
535	   possibility of including non-ASCII data in the content value.

537	   When non-ASCII data is used, interpretation may become ambiguous.
538	   For this reason, it is RECOMMENDED that text in content values be
539	   encoded in UTF-8 [RFC3629], conform to the Network Unicode format
540	   [RFC5198], and use a subset of Unicode code points consistent with
541	   [RFC9839] (Section 4.3), with the exception of %x09, %x0A, and %x0D,
542	   which are best avoided.

544	   Processors are RECOMMENDED to handle such encodings to ensure that
545	   non-ASCII content values are correctly interpreted and represented.

547	   Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) (e.g., in the "furi=" content
548	   tag) MAY appear as A-labels as well as U-labels [RFC5890], with
549	   U-labels encoded as described above.

551	   Implementation Note: Some DNS query tools return DNS records in
552	   presentation format, rather than the underlying RDATA content.
553	   Parsers of the ABNF in this document MUST ensure they operate on the
554	   raw TXT RDATA content, not its escaped presentation format [RFC1035]
555	   (Section 5.1).  If the TXT RDATA consists of multiple character-
556	   strings, they SHOULD be concatenated into a single contiguous string
557	   prior to being interpreted as a UTF-8 encoded value matching the
558	   ABNF.

560	   See Section 3.6 for additional guidelines and the Security
561	   Considerations section for possible risks.

563	3.3.  Currency

565	   The ABNF in Section 2.1 allows currency codes consisting of one or
566	   more uppercase letters, providing flexibility to accommodate both
567	   standard fiat currencies and other widely recognised abbreviations,
568	   such as cryptocurrencies.

570	   The use of standard fiat currencies is RECOMMENDED.  When used, they
571	   MUST be represented by three-letter uppercase currency codes as
572	   specified in [ISO4217] (e.g., USD, EUR, GBP and JPY).

574	   The amount component consists of an integer part, optionally followed
575	   by a fractional part separated by a decimal point (%x2E, ".").

577	3.4.  TTLs

579	   Long TTLs [RFC1035] (Section 3.2.1) increase the risk of outdated
580	   data misleading buyers into thinking the domain is still available or
581	   that advertised prices remain current.

583	   A TTL of 3600 seconds (1 hour) or less is RECOMMENDED and the TTL
584	   values of all records in an RRset have to be the same [RFC2181]
585	   (Section 5.2).

587	3.5.  Ambiguous Constructs

589	   Ambiguous constructs in content values SHOULD be avoided, as
590	   illustrated by the following example:

592	   _for-sale IN TXT "v=FORSALE1;fcod=TRIP-confusing;ftxt=dont_do_this"

594	   The above example is a valid "fcod=" content tag that includes the
595	   string ";ftxt=" in the content value, which may be confusing, as it
596	   does not actually represent an "ftxt=" content tag.

598	3.6.  Robustness

600	   Because the format of the content part is not strictly defined in
601	   this document, processors MAY apply the robustness principle of being
602	   liberal in what they accept.  This also applies to space characters
603	   (%x20) immediately following the version tag.

605	   Alternatively, parties may agree on a more strictly defined
606	   proprietary format for the content value to reduce ambiguity.
607	   However, it is out of scope to discuss which mechanisms are put in
608	   place for such agreements.

610	   When encountering unexpected, or prohibited control characters in
611	   "ftxt=" content (e.g., %x09, %x0A, %x0B, %x0D, see Section 3.2),
612	   processors MAY sanitise them by replacing them with spaces (%x20) to
613	   ensure correct representation, or replacing them with the Unicode
614	   REPLACEMENT CHARACTER U+FFFD (%xEF.BF.BD) to signal the presence of
615	   problematic content.

617	3.7.  Scope of Application

619	   The "_for-sale" mechanism relies upon the domain name being
620	   resolvable in the DNS.  This is not guaranteed, for example, during a
621	   redemption period, in pendingDelete status [STD69], or when the
622	   domain is DNSSEC-signed but fails validation (i.e., has a bogus
623	   state).

625	4.  Security Considerations

627	   One use of the TXT record type defined in this document is to parse
628	   the content it contains and to publish certain information from it on
629	   a website or elsewhere.  However, there is a risk if the domain name
630	   holder publishes a malicious URI or one that points to improper
631	   content.  This may result in reputational damage to the party parsing
632	   the record.

634	   An even more serious scenario arises when the content of the TXT
635	   record is not properly validated and sanitised, potentially enabling
636	   attacks such as XSS or SQL injection, as well as spoofing techniques
637	   based on Unicode manipulation, including bidirectional text attacks
638	   and homograph attacks.

640	   Therefore, parsing and publishing this information requires careful
641	   validation to ensure that only valid characters and formats are
642	   processed.  Possible mitigation strategies include output
643	   sanitisation, maintaining a curated and validated list of URIs, or
644	   applying other validation methods, such as URI reputation checks
645	   before display.

647	   Automatically following URIs from "_for-sale" records without user
648	   consent creates security risks, including exposure to malware,
649	   phishing pages, and scripted attacks.  Processors MUST NOT
650	   automatically redirect users when encountering "furi=" content tags
651	   without requiring explicit confirmation before navigation.  This
652	   allows users to inspect the destination before proceeding.

654	   There is also a risk that this method will be abused as a marketing
655	   tool, or to lure individuals into visiting certain sites or making
656	   contact by other means, without there being any intention to actually
657	   sell the domain name.

659	   Domain name holders may advertise artificially low prices and
660	   processors that present "fval=" data to users SHOULD display
661	   appropriate disclaimers (e.g., "Price indicative only - verify with
662	   seller").  Automated systems SHOULD NOT make purchase commitments
663	   based solely on advertised prices without human verification.

665	5.  Privacy Considerations

667	   The use of the "_for-sale" leaf node name publicly indicates the
668	   intent to sell a domain name.  Domain name holders should be aware
669	   that this information is accessible to anyone querying the DNS and
670	   may have privacy implications.

672	   There is a risk of data scraping, such as email addresses and phone
673	   numbers.

675	   Publishing contact information may expose domain name holders to
676	   spam, or unwanted contact.

678	6.  Implementation Status

680	   The concept described in this document has been in use at the .nl
681	   ccTLD registry since 2022, when it initially started as a pilot.
682	   Since then, hundreds of thousands of domain names have been marked
683	   with the "_for-sale" indicator.  See for example:

685	   https://www.sidn.nl/en/whois?q=example.nl

687	   The Dutch domain name registry SIDN offers registrars the option to
688	   register a sales landing page via its registrar dashboard following
689	   the "fcod=" method.  When this option is used, a unique code is
690	   generated, which can be included in the "_for-sale" record.  If such
691	   a domain name is entered on the domain finder page of SIDN, a "for
692	   sale" button is displayed accordingly.

694	   A simple demonstration of a validator is present at:

696	   https://forsalereg.sidnlabs.nl/demo

698	   <NOTE TO RFC EDITOR: Please remove this section before publication as
699	   per RFC7942.>

701	7.  IANA Considerations

703	   IANA is requested to add the following entry to the "Underscored and
704	   Globally Scoped DNS Node Names" registry [RFC8552] :

706	                  +=========+============+=============+
707	                  | RR Type | _NODE NAME | Reference   |

859	Appendix A.  Additional Examples

861	A.1.  Example 1: Code Format

863	   A proprietary format, defined and used by agreement between parties -
864	   for example, a domain name registry and its registrars - without a
865	   clearly specified meaning for third parties.  For example, it may be
866	   used to automatically redirect visitors to a web page, as described
867	   in Section 2.2.1:

869	   _for-sale IN TXT "v=FORSALE1;fcod=XX-aHR0cHM...wbGUuY29t"

871	   Note: the content value in the above example is truncated for
872	   readability.

874	   The use of the "fcod=" content tag is, in principle, unrestricted,
875	   allowing implementers to define additional uses as needed.  For
876	   example, it may convey arbitrary formatting or conditional display
877	   instructions, such as adding an extra banner (e.g., "eligibility
878	   criteria apply") or specifying a style, including color, font,
879	   emojis, or logos.

881	A.2.  Example 2: Free Text Format

883	   Free format text, with some additional unstructured information,
884	   aimed at being human-readable:

886	   _for-sale IN TXT "v=FORSALE1;ftxt=Eligibility criteria apply."

888	   The content in the following example could be malicious, but it is
889	   not in violation of the convention in this document (see the Security
890	   Considerations):

892	   _for-sale IN TXT "v=FORSALE1;ftxt=<script>...</script>"

894	A.3.  Example 3: URI Format

896	   The holder of "example.com" wishes to signal that the domain is for
897	   sale and adds this record to the "example.com" zone:

899	   _for-sale IN TXT "v=FORSALE1;furi=https://example.com/fs?d=eHl6"

901	   An interested party notices this signal and can visit the URI
902	   mentioned for further information.  The TXT record may also be
903	   processed by automated tools, but see the Security Considerations
904	   section for possible risks.

906	   As an alternative, a mailto: URI could also be used:

908	   _for-sale IN TXT "v=FORSALE1;furi=mailto:hq@example.com?subject=foo"

910	   Or a telephone URI:

912	   _for-sale IN TXT "v=FORSALE1;furi=tel:+1-201-555-0123"

914	   There can be a use case for these URIs, especially since WHOIS (or
915	   RDAP) often has privacy restrictions.  But see the Privacy
916	   Considerations section for possible downsides.

918	A.4.  Example 4: Asking Price Format

920	   Consists of an uppercase currency code (e.g., USD, EUR), followed by
921	   a numeric amount.  See Section 3.3 for additional guidelines.

923	   In Bitcoins:

925	   _for-sale IN TXT "v=FORSALE1;fval=BTC0.000010"

927	   In US dollars:

929	   _for-sale IN TXT "v=FORSALE1;fval=USD750"

931	A.5.  Example 5: Combinations

933	   An example of multiple valid TXT records from which a processor can
934	   choose:

936	   _for-sale IN TXT "v=FORSALE1;furi=https://fs.example.com/"
937	             IN TXT "v=FORSALE1;ftxt=This domain name is for sale"
938	             IN TXT "v=FORSALE1;fval=EUR500"
939	             IN TXT "v=FORSALE1;fcod=EXCO-ZGVhZGJlZWYx"
940	             IN TXT "v=FORSALE1;fcod=XYZ1-MTExLTIyMi0zMzMtNDQ0"
