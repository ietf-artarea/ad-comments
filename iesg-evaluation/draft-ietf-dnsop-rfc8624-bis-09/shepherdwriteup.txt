Technical Summary:

The DNSSEC protocol makes use of various cryptographic algorithms to provide
authentication of DNS data and proof of non-existence. To ensure
interoperability between DNS resolvers and DNS authoritative servers, it is
necessary to specify both a set of algorithm implementation requirements and
usage guidelines to ensure that there is at least one algorithm that all
implementations support. This document updates [<a href="/doc/rfc8624/">RFC8624</a>] by moving the
canonical source of algorithm implementation requirements and usage guidance
for DNSSEC from [<a href="/doc/rfc8624/">RFC8624</a>] to an IANA registry. Future extensions to this
registry can be made under new, incremental update RFCs.

Working Group Summary:

WG consensus was solid. There was discussions around Section 2 "Adding usage
and implementation recommendations to the IANA DNSSEC tables", but nothing in
conflict.

Document Quality:

Document quality is very good.  As this document is updating IANA tables, it is
more about documenting existing usage and not about implemenetations.
