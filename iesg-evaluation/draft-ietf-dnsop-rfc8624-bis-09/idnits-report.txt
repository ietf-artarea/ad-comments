8	      DNSSEC Cryptographic Algorithm Recommendation Update Process
9	                    draft-ietf-dnsop-rfc8624-bis-09

11	Abstract

13	   The DNSSEC protocol makes use of various cryptographic algorithms to
14	   provide authentication of DNS data and proof of non-existence.  To
15	   ensure interoperability between DNS resolvers and DNS authoritative
16	   servers, it is necessary to specify both a set of algorithm
17	   implementation requirements and usage guidelines to ensure that there
18	   is at least one algorithm that all implementations support.  This
19	   document updates RFC8624 by moving the canonical source of algorithm
20	   implementation requirements and usage guidance for DNSSEC from
21	   RFC8624 to an IANA registry.  This is done both to allow the list to
22	   be more easily updated, and to allow the list to be more easily
23	   referenced.  Future extensions to this registry can be made under
24	   new, incremental update RFCs.  This document also incorporates the
25	   revised IANA DNSSEC considerations from [RFC9157].

27	   The document does not change the status (MUST, MAY, RECOMMENDED, etc)
28	   of any of the algorithms listed in RFC8624; that is the work of
29	   future documents.

97	1.  Introduction

99	   DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) [RFC9364] is used to provide
100	   authentication of DNS data.  The DNSSEC signing algorithms are
101	   defined by various RFCs, including [RFC4034], [RFC4509], [RFC5155],
102	   [RFC5702], [RFC5933], [RFC6605], [RFC8080].

104	   To ensure interoperability, a set of "mandatory to implement" DNSKEY
105	   algorithms are defined in [RFC8624].  To make the current status of
106	   the algorithms more easily accessible and understandable, and to make
107	   future changes to these recommendations easier to publish, this
108	   document moves the canonical status of the algorithms from [RFC8624]
109	   to the IANA DNSSEC algorithm registries.  Additionally, as advice to
110	   operators, it adds recommendations for deploying and the usage of
111	   these algorithms.

113	   This is similar to the process used for the [TLS-ciphersuites]
114	   registry, where the canonical list of ciphersuites is in the IANA
115	   registry, and the RFCs reference the IANA registry.

117	1.1.  Document Audience

119	   The columns added to the IANA "DNS Security Algorithm Numbers"
120	   [DNSKEY-IANA] and "DNSSEC Delegation Signer (DS) Resource Record (RR)
121	   Type Digest Algorithms" [DS-IANA] registries target DNSSEC operators
122	   and implementers.

124	   Implementations need to meet both high security expectations as well
125	   as provide interoperability between various vendors and with
126	   different versions.

128	   The field of cryptography evolves continuously.  New, stronger
129	   algorithms appear, and existing algorithms may be found to be less
130	   secure than originally thought.  Therefore, algorithm implementation
131	   requirements and usage guidance need to be updated from time to time
132	   in order to reflect the new reality, and to allow for a smooth
133	   transition to more secure algorithms, as well as deprecation of
134	   algorithms deemed to no longer be secure.

136	   Implementations need to be conservative in the selection of
137	   algorithms they implement in order to minimize both code complexity
138	   and the attack surface.

140	   The perspective of implementers may differ from that of an operator
141	   who wishes to deploy and configure DNSSEC with only the safest
142	   algorithm.  As such this document also adds new recommendations about
143	   which algorithms should be deployed regardless of implementation
144	   status.  In general it is expected that deployment of aging
145	   algorithms should generally be reduced before implementations stop
146	   supporting them.

148	1.2.  Updating Algorithm Requirement Levels

150	   By the time a DNSSEC cryptographic algorithm is made mandatory to
151	   implement, it should already be available in most implementations.
152	   This document defines an IANA registration modification to allow
153	   future documents to specify the implementation recommendations for
154	   each algorithm, as the recommendation status of each DNSSEC
155	   cryptographic algorithm is expected to change over time.  For
156	   example, there is no guarantee that newly introduced algorithms will
157	   become mandatory to implement in the future.  Likewise, published
158	   algorithms are continuously subjected to cryptographic attack and may
159	   become too weak, or even be completely broken, and will require
160	   deprecation in the future.

162	   It is expected that the deprecation of an algorithm will be performed
163	   gradually.  This provides time for implementations to update their
164	   implemented algorithms while remaining interoperable.  Unless there
165	   are strong security reasons, an algorithm is expected to be
166	   downgraded from MUST to NOT RECOMMENDED or MAY, instead of directly
167	   from MUST to MUST NOT.  Similarly, an algorithm that has not been
168	   mentioned as mandatory to implement is expected to be first
169	   introduced as RECOMMENDED instead of a MUST.

171	   Since the effect of using an unknown DNSKEY algorithm is that the
172	   zone is treated as insecure, it is recommended that algorithms which
173	   have been downgraded to NOT RECOMMENDED or lower not be used by
174	   authoritative nameservers and DNSSEC signers to create new DNSKEY's.
175	   This will allow for deprecated algorithms to become used less and
176	   less over time.  Once an algorithm has reached a sufficiently low
177	   level of deployment, it can be marked as MUST NOT, so that recursive
178	   resolvers can remove support for validating it.

180	   Validating recursive resolvers are encouraged to retain support for
181	   all algorithms not marked as MUST NOT.

183	1.3.  Requirements notation

185	   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
186	   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
187	   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
188	   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
189	   capitals, as shown here.

191	   [RFC2119] considers the term SHOULD equivalent to RECOMMENDED, and
192	   SHOULD NOT equivalent to NOT RECOMMENDED.  The authors of this
193	   document have chosen to use the terms RECOMMENDED and NOT
194	   RECOMMENDED, as this more clearly expresses the recommendations to
195	   implementers.

197	2.  Adding usage and implementation recommendations to the IANA DNSSEC
198	    registries

200	   Per this document, the following columns are being added to the
201	   following DNSSEC algorithm registries registered with IANA:

203	   +================================+==================================+
204	   | Registry                       | Column added                     |

224	   +--------------------------------+----------------------------------+

226	      Table 1: Columns to add to existing DNSSEC algorithm registries

228	   Adding a new entry to the "DNS System Algorithm Numbers" registry
229	   with a recommended value of "MAY" in the "Use for DNSSSEC Signing",
230	   "Use for DNSSSEC Validation", "Implement for DNSSSEC Signing", or
231	   "Implement for DNSSSEC Validation" columns SHALL follow the
232	   "Specification Required" policy as defined in [RFC8126] in order to
233	   promote continued evolution of DNSSEC algorithms and DNSSEC agility.
234	   New entries added through the "Specification Required" process will
235	   have the value of "MAY" for all columns.  (Ed note (RFC Editor -
236	   please delete this before publication): As a reminder: the
237	   "Specification Required" policy includes a requirement for a
238	   designated expert to review the request.)

240	   Adding a new entry to, or changing existing values in, the "DNS
241	   System Algorithm Numbers" registry for the "Use for DNSSSEC Signing",
242	   "Use for DNSSSEC Validation", "Implement for DNSSSEC Signing", or
243	   "Implement for DNSSSEC Validation" columns to any other value than
244	   "MAY" requires a Standards Action.

246	   Adding a new entry to the "Digest Algorithms" registry with a
247	   recommended value of "MAY" in the "Use for DNSSSEC Delegation", "Use
248	   for DNSSSEC Validation", "Implement for DNSSSEC Delegation", or
249	   "Implement for DNSSSEC Validation" columns SHALL follow the
250	   "Specification Required" policy as defined in [RFC8126].

252	   Adding a new entry to, or changing existing values in, the "DNS
253	   System Algorithm Numbers" registry for the "Use for DNSSSEC
254	   Delegation", "Use for DNSSSEC Validation", "Implement for DNSSSEC
255	   Delegation", or "Implement for DNSSSEC Validation" columns to any
256	   other value than "MAY" requires a Standards Action.

258	   If an item is not marked as "RECOMMENDED", it does not necessarily
259	   mean that it is flawed; rather, it indicates that the item either has
260	   not been through the IETF consensus process, has limited
261	   applicability, or is intended only for specific use cases.

263	   The following sections state the initial values to be populated into
264	   these rows.  The "Implement for" column values are transcribed from
265	   [RFC8624].  The "Use for" columns are set to the same values as the
266	   "implement for" values since the general interpretation to date
267	   indicates they have been treated as values for both "implementation"
268	   and "use".  We note that the values for "Implement for" and "Use for"
269	   may diverge in the future

271	3.  DNS System Algorithm Numbers Column Values

273	   Initial recommendation columns of use and implementation
274	   recommendations for the "Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC)
275	   Algorithm Numbers" are shown in Table 2.

277	   When there are multiple RECOMMENDED algorithms in the "use" column,
278	   operators should choose the best algorithm according to local policy.

356	5.  Security Considerations

358	   This document makes no modifications to the security of the existing
359	   protocol or recommendations described in [RFC8624].  Thus, the
360	   security considerations remain the same, which we quote below.

362	   The security of cryptographic systems depends on both the strength of
363	   the cryptographic algorithms chosen and the strength of the keys used
364	   with those algorithms.  The security also depends on the engineering
365	   of the protocol used by the system to ensure that there are no non-
366	   cryptographic ways to bypass the security of the overall system.

368	   This document concerns itself with the selection of cryptographic
369	   algorithms for the use of DNSSEC, specifically with the selection of
370	   "mandatory to implement" algorithms.  The algorithms identified in
371	   this document as "MUST" or "RECOMMENDED" to implement are not known
372	   to be broken at the current time, and cryptographic research so far
373	   leads us to believe that they are likely to remain adequately secure
374	   unless significant and unexpected discovery is made.  However, this
375	   isn't necessarily forever, and it is expected that future documents
376	   will be issued from time to time to reflect the current best
377	   practices in this area.

379	   Retiring an algorithm too soon would result in a zone signed with the
380	   retired algorithm being downgraded to the equivalent of an unsigned
381	   zone.  Therefore, algorithm deprecation must be done only after
382	   careful consideration and ideally slowly when possible.

384	6.  Operational Considerations

386	   DNSKEY algorithm rollover in a live zone is a complex process.  See
387	   [RFC6781] and [RFC7583] for guidelines on how to perform algorithm
388	   rollovers.

390	   DS algorithm rollover in a live zone is also a complex process.
391	   Upgrading algorithm at the same time as rolling the new KSK key will
392	   lead to DNSSEC validation failures, and users MUST upgrade the DS
393	   algorithm first before rolling the Key Signing Key.

395	7.  IANA Considerations

397	   The IANA is requested to update the [DNSKEY-IANA] and [DS-IANA]
398	   registries according to the following sections.

400	7.1.  Update to the "DNS Security Algorithm Numbers" registry

402	   This document requests IANA update the "DNS Security Algorithm
403	   Numbers" registry ([DNSKEY-IANA]) registry with the following
404	   additional columns:

406	   *  "Use for DNSSEC Signing"

408	   *  "Use for DNSSEC Validation"

410	   *  "Implement for DNSSEC Signing"

412	   *  "Implement for DNSSEC Validation"

414	   These values must be populated using values from Table 2 of this
415	   document.

417	   Additionally, the registration policy for the [DNSKEY-IANA] registry
418	   should match the text describing the requirements in this document.

420	7.2.  Update to the "Digest Algorithms" registry

422	   This document requests IANA update the "Digest Algorithms" registry
423	   ([DS-IANA]) registry with the following additional columns:

425	   *  "Use for DNSSEC Delegation"

427	   *  "Use for DNSSEC Validation"

429	   *  "Implement for DNSSEC Delegation"

431	   *  "Implement for DNSSEC Validation"

433	   These values must be populated using values from Table 3 of this
434	   document.

436	   *  Update the registration policy for the [DS-IANA] registry to match
437	      the text describing update requirements above.

439	   *  Mark values 128 - 252 as "Reserved"

441	   *  Mark values 253 and 254 as "Reserved for Private Use"

443	   *  Delete the (now superfluous) column "Status" from the registry

445	   Additionally, the registration policy for the [DS-IANA] registry
446	   should match the text describing the requirements in this document.
