# Document Shepherd Write-Up for Group Documents

*This version is dated 4 July 2022.*

Thank you for your service as a document shepherd. Among the responsibilities is
answering the questions in this write-up to give helpful context to Last Call
and Internet Engineering Steering Group ([IESG][1]) reviewers, and your
diligence in completing it is appreciated. The full role of the shepherd is
further described in [<a href="/doc/rfc4858/">RFC 4858</a>][2]. You will need the cooperation of the authors
and editors to complete these checks.

Note that some numbered items contain multiple related questions; please be sure
to answer all of them.

## Document History

1. Does the working group (WG) consensus represent the strong concurrence of a
few individuals, with others being silent, or did it reach broad agreement?

As is common with REGEXT, the WGLC only elicited responses from a few members,
but those responses were uniformly supportive of publication, with constructive
feedback which was then incorporated into the draft.

2. Was there controversy about particular points, or were there decisions where
the consensus was particularly rough?

There was no controversy or roughness of consensus.

3. Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If
so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the
responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this
questionnaire is publicly available.)

No.

4. For protocol documents, are there existing implementations of the contents of
the document? Have a significant number of potential implementers indicated
plans to implement? Are any existing implementations reported somewhere,
either in the document itself (as [<a href="/doc/rfc7942/">RFC 7942</a>][3] recommends) or elsewhere
(where)?

The authors of this documents represent two of the Regional Internet Registries.
Of these, RIPE NCC has a production implementation which is listed in the
"Implementation Status" section of the document, while ARIN plans to implement
once the document has been published as an RFC.

## Additional Reviews

5. Do the contents of this document closely interact with technologies in other
IETF working groups or external organizations, and would it therefore benefit
from their review? Have those reviews occurred? If yes, describe which
reviews took place.

This document describes how RIRs can use RDAP to publish the URL of Geofeed data
files. These files are described in <a href="/doc/rfc9632/">RFC 9632</a> which was produced by OPSAWG.

There is a loose interaction between the contents of this document and the
Geofeed specification, namely a one-way hyperlink. This document also specifies
a Media Type registration for Geofeed files.

Given the unique nature of OPSAWG, a separate review of this document by that
WG seems unnecessary.

6. Describe how the document meets any required formal expert review criteria,
such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.

This document registers entries in the Media Types and Structured Syntax
Suffixes registries, which appear to be well-formed.

7. If the document contains a YANG module, has the final version of the module
been checked with any of the [recommended validation tools][4] for syntax and
formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is
the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module
comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified
in [<a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC 8342</a>][5]?

Not applicable to this document.

8. Describe reviews and automated checks performed to validate sections of the
final version of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code,
BNF rules, MIB definitions, CBOR's CDDL, etc.

There are several JSON examples in the document. The authors have informed me
that these have been manually checked. Because some of these examples are elided
and are therefore not valid JSON, automated checks are not possible.

## Document Shepherd Checks

9. Based on the shepherd's review of the document, is it their opinion that this
document is needed, clearly written, complete, correctly designed, and ready
to be handed off to the responsible Area Director?

Yes. Based on my reading of this document, this document fulfills a clear need,
it is clearly written and complete, understandable and implementable, correctly
designed, and ready for AD review.

10. Several IETF Areas have assembled [lists of common issues that their
reviewers encounter][6]. For which areas have such issues been identified
and addressed? For which does this still need to happen in subsequent
reviews?

The authors have submitted the media type registration for review, as per the
advice in the "Media Types" section of the "Typical ART Area Issues" page on
<a href="http://wiki.ietf.org">wiki.ietf.org</a>. No negative feedback has been received. No other issues appear
applicable.

11. What type of RFC publication is being requested on the IETF stream ([Best
Current Practice][12], [Proposed Standard, Internet Standard][13],
[Informational, Experimental or Historic][14])? Why is this the proper type
of RFC? Do all Datatracker state attributes correctly reflect this intent?

This document is on the standards track as reflected by the datatracker. This
is an IETF-authored RDAP extension and is appropriate for the standards track.

12. Have reasonable efforts been made to remind all authors of the intellectual
property rights (IPR) disclosure obligations described in [<a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a>][7]? To
the best of your knowledge, have all required disclosures been filed? If
not, explain why. If yes, summarize any relevant discussion, including links
to publicly-available messages when applicable.

Yes. The authors have indicated that there are no Intellectual Property Rights
associated with this document.

13. Has each author, editor, and contributor shown their willingness to be
listed as such? If the total number of authors and editors on the front page
is greater than five, please provide a justification.

Yes, both authors have indicated their willingess to be listed as such.

14. Document any remaining I-D nits in this document. Simply running the [idnits
tool][8] is not enough; please review the ["Content Guidelines" on
<a href="http://authors.ietf.org">authors.ietf.org</a>][15]. (Also note that the current idnits tool generates
some incorrect warnings; a rewrite is underway.)

The idnits tool reports two related issues which seem false positives: the first
claims that the document lacks a normative reference to <a href="/doc/rfc2119/">RFC 2119</a> (the document
has a normative reference to <a href="/doc/bcp14/">BCP 14</a> instead). The second warns of a downref, to
the aforementioned <a href="/doc/bcp14/">BCP 14</a>.

15. Should any informative references be normative or vice-versa? See the [IESG
Statement on Normative and Informative References][16].

I have reviewed and do not believe there are any miscategorised references.

16. List any normative references that are not freely available to anyone. Did
the community have sufficient access to review any such normative
references?

Not applicable.

17. Are there any normative downward references (see [<a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>][9] and [<a href="/doc/bcp97/">BCP
97</a>][10]) that are not already listed in the [DOWNREF registry][17]? If so,
list them.

Not applicable.

18. Are there normative references to documents that are not ready to be
submitted to the IESG for publication or are otherwise in an unclear state?
If so, what is the plan for their completion?

Not applicable.

19. Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? If
so, does the Datatracker metadata correctly reflect this and are those RFCs
listed on the title page, in the abstract, and discussed in the
introduction? If not, explain why and point to the part of the document
where the relationship of this document to these other RFCs is discussed.

Not applicable.

20. Describe the document shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section,
especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document.
Confirm that all aspects of the document requiring IANA assignments are
associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm
that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm
that each newly created IANA registry specifies its initial contents,
allocations procedures, and a reasonable name (see [<a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>][11]).

This document registers entries in the Media Types and Structured Syntax
Suffixes registries, which appear to be consistent with the body of the document
and are well-formed.

21. List any new IANA registries that require Designated Expert Review for
future allocations. Are the instructions to the Designated Expert clear?
Please include suggestions of designated experts, if appropriate.

Not applicable.
