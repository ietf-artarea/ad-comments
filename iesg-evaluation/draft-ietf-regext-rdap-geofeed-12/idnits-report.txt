87	1.  Introduction

89	   [RFC8805] and [RFC9632] detail the IP geolocation feed (commonly
90	   known as 'geofeed') file format and associated access mechanisms.
91	   While [RFC9632] describes how a registry can make geofeed URLs
92	   available by way of a Routing Policy Specification Language (RPSL)
93	   [RFC2622] service, the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) have
94	   deployed Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) ([RFC7480],
95	   [RFC7481], [RFC9082], [RFC9083]) services as successors for RPSL for
96	   Internet number resource registrations, and maintaining feature
97	   parity between the two services supports client transition from RPSL
98	   to RDAP in this context.  To that end, this document specifies how
99	   geofeed URLs can be accessed through RDAP.  It defines a new RDAP
100	   extension, "geofeed1", for indicating that an RDAP server hosts
101	   geofeed URLs for its IP network objects, as well as a new media type
102	   and a new link relation type for the associated link objects.

104	   Fetching and making use of geofeed data is out of scope for the
105	   purposes of this document.  See [RFC8805] and [RFC9632] for further
106	   details.

108	   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
109	   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
110	   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
111	   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
112	   capitals, as shown here.

114	   Indentation and whitespace in examples are provided only to
115	   illustrate element relationships, and are not a required feature of
116	   this specification.

118	   "..." in examples is used as shorthand for elements defined outside
119	   of this document.

121	2.  Specification

123	2.1.  Media Type for a Geofeed Link

125	   [RFC9632] requires a geofeed file to be a UTF-8 [RFC3629] comma-
126	   separated values (CSV) file, with a series of "#" comments at the end
127	   for the optional Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI, [RFC6480])
128	   signature.  At first glance, the "text/csv" media type seems like a
129	   good candidate for a geofeed file, since it supports the "#" comments
130	   needed for including the RPKI signature.

132	   However, although the CSV geofeed data could be viewed directly by a
133	   user such that the "text/csv" media type was appropriate, the most
134	   common use case will involve it being processed by some sort of
135	   application first, in order to facilitate subsequent IP address
136	   lookup operations.  Therefore, using a new "application" media type
137	   with a "geofeed" subtype (Section 4.2.5 of [RFC6838]) for the geofeed
138	   data is preferable to using "text/csv".

140	   To that end, this document registers a new "application/geofeed+csv"
141	   media type in the IANA Media Types Registry (see Section 6.3), and a
142	   new "+csv" suffix in the IANA Structured Syntax Suffixes Registry
143	   (see Section 6.4).

145	2.2.  Geofeed Link

147	   An RDAP server that hosts geofeed URLs for its IP network objects
148	   (Section 5.4 of [RFC9083]) may include link objects for those geofeed
149	   URLs in IP network objects in its responses.  These link objects are
150	   added to the "links" member of each object (Section 4.2 of
151	   [RFC9083]).

153	   In RDAP, the "value", "rel", and "href" JSON members are required for
154	   any link object.  Additionally, for a geofeed link object, the "type"
155	   JSON member is RECOMMENDED.  The geofeed-specific components of a
156	   link object are like so:

158	   *  "rel" -- The link relation type is set to "geofeed".  This is a
159	      new link relation type for IP geolocation feed data, registered in
160	      the IANA Link Relations Registry (see Section 6.2) by this
161	      document.
162	   *  "href" -- The target URL is set to the HTTPS URL of the geofeed
163	      file (Section 6 of [RFC9632]) for an IP network.
164	   *  "type" -- "application/geofeed+csv" (see Section 2.1).

166	   An IP network object returned by an RDAP server MAY contain zero or
167	   more geofeed link objects, though typically an IP network will have
168	   either no such link objects or only one.  The scenario where more
169	   than one geofeed link object could be returned is when the server is
170	   able to represent that data in multiple languages.  In such a case,
171	   the server SHOULD provide "hreflang" members for the geofeed link
172	   objects.  Except for the multiple-languages scenario, the server
173	   SHOULD NOT return more than one geofeed link object.

175	2.3.  Extension Identifier

177	   This document defines a new extension identifier, "geofeed1", for use
178	   by servers that host geofeed URLs for their IP network objects and
179	   include geofeed URL link objects in their responses to clients in
180	   accordance with Section 2.2.  A server that uses this extension
181	   identifier MUST include it in the "rdapConformance" array
182	   (Section 4.1 of [RFC9083]) for any lookup or search response
183	   containing an IP network object, as well as in the help response.
184	   Here is an elided example for this inclusion:

186	   {
187	       "rdapConformance": [ "rdap_level_0", "geofeed1", ... ],
188	       ...
189	   }
190	   If the server includes "geofeed1" in the "rdapConformance" array,
191	   then for any response concerning a particular IP network object for
192	   which the server possesses a geofeed URL and is able to return it to
193	   the client, the server MUST include a corresponding geofeed link
194	   object in the response.

196	   An RDAP server may make use of the "application/geofeed+csv" media
197	   type and the "geofeed" link relation defined in this specification in
198	   its responses without including the "geofeed1" extension identifier
199	   in those responses, because RDAP servers are free to use any
200	   registered media type or link relation in a standard response without
201	   implementing any particular extension.  The additional value of
202	   including the extension identifier in the "rdapConformance" array is
203	   that it signals to the client that the server hosts geofeed URLs for
204	   its IP network objects.  This is useful where a client receives an IP
205	   network object without a geofeed link object, because in that case
206	   the client can infer that no geofeed data is available for that
207	   object, since the server would have provided it if it were available.

209	   Although a server may use registered media types in its link objects
210	   without any restrictions, it is useful to define new RDAP extensions
211	   for those media types in order for the server to communicate to
212	   clients that it will make data for that type accessible, in the same
213	   way that the server does with the "geofeed1" extension identifier.

215	2.4.  Example

217	   The following is an elided example of an IP network object with a
218	   geofeed link object:

220	   {
221	       "objectClassName": "ip network",
222	       "handle": "XXXX-RIR",
223	       "startAddress": "2001:db8::",
224	       "endAddress": "2001:db8:0:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff",
225	       "ipVersion": "v6",
226	       "name": "NET-RTR-1",
227	       "type": "DIRECT ALLOCATION",
228	       "country": "AU",
229	       "parentHandle": "YYYY-RIR",
230	       "status": [ "active" ],
231	       "links":
232	        [
233	           {
234	               "value": "https://example.net/ip/2001:db8::/48",
235	               "rel": "self",
236	               "href": "https://example.net/ip/2001:db8::/48",
237	               "type": "application/rdap+json"
238	           },
239	           {
240	               "value": "https://example.net/ip/2001:db8::/48",
241	               "rel": "geofeed",
242	               "href": "https://example.com/geofeed",
243	               "type": "application/geofeed+csv"
244	           },
245	           ...
246	       ],
247	       ...
248	   }

250	3.  Operational Considerations

252	   When an RDAP client performs an IP network lookup, per Section 3.1.1
253	   of [RFC9082], the RDAP server is required to return the most-specific
254	   IP network object that covers the IP address range provided by the
255	   client.  That IP network object may not have an associated geofeed
256	   link, but it is possible that a less-specific IP network object does
257	   have such a link.  Clients attempting to retrieve geofeed data for a
258	   given IP address range via RDAP should consider whether to retrieve
259	   the parent object for the initial response (and so on, recursively)
260	   in the event that the initial response does not contain geofeed data.
261	   Conversely, server operators should consider interface options for
262	   resource holders in order to support the provisioning of geofeed
263	   links for all networks covered by the associated data.

265	   It is common for a resource holder to maintain a single geofeed file
266	   containing the geofeed data for all of their resources.  The resource
267	   holder then updates each of their network object registrations to
268	   refer to that single geofeed file.  As with geofeed references in
269	   inetnum objects (per [RFC9632]), clients who find a geofeed link
270	   object within an IP network object and opt to retrieve the data from
271	   the associated link MUST ignore any entry where the entry's IP
272	   address range is outside the IP network object's address range.

274	   Section 3.2 of [RFC8805] recommends that consumers of geofeed data
275	   verify that the publisher of the data is authoritative for the
276	   relevant resources.  The RDAP bootstrap process ([RFC9224]) helps
277	   clients with this recommendation, since a client following that
278	   process will be directed to the RDAP server that is able to make
279	   authoritative statements about the disposition of the relevant
280	   resources.

282	   To prevent undue load on RDAP and geofeed servers, clients fetching
283	   geofeed data using these mechanisms MUST NOT do frequent real-time
284	   lookups.  See Section 6 of [RFC9632] for further details.

286	4.  Privacy Considerations

288	   All the privacy considerations from Section 7 of [RFC9632] apply to
289	   this document.  In particular, the service provider publishing the
290	   geofeed file MUST take care not to expose the location of any
291	   individual.

293	   Many jurisdictions have laws or regulations that restrict the use of
294	   "personal data", per the definition in [RFC6973].  Given that,
295	   registry operators should ascertain whether the regulatory
296	   environment in which they operate permits implementation of the
297	   functionality defined in this document.

299	5.  Security Considerations

301	   Section 6 of [RFC9632] documents several security considerations that
302	   are equally relevant in the RDAP context.

304	   A geofeed file MUST be referenced with an HTTPS URL, per Section 6 of
305	   [RFC9632].  The geofeed file may also contain an RPKI signature, per
306	   Section 5 of [RFC9632].

308	   Besides that, this document does not introduce any new security
309	   considerations past those already discussed in the RDAP protocol
310	   specifications ([RFC7481], [RFC9560]).

312	6.  IANA Considerations
313	6.1.  RDAP Extensions Registry

315	   IANA is requested to register the following value in the RDAP
316	   Extensions Registry at [RDAP-EXTENSIONS]:

318	   *  Extension identifier: geofeed1
319	   *  Registry operator: Any
320	   *  Published specification: This document.
321	   *  Contact: IETF, iesg@ietf.org
322	   *  Intended usage: This extension describes a method to access the IP
323	      geolocation feed data through RDAP.

325	6.2.  Link Relations Registry

327	   IANA is requested to register the following value in the Link
328	   Relations Registry at [LINK-RELATIONS]:

330	   *  Relation Name: geofeed
331	   *  Description: Refers to a resource with IP geofeed location
332	      information related to the link context.
333	   *  Reference: This document.

335	6.3.  Media Types Registry

337	   IANA is requested to register the following value in the Media Types
338	   Registry at [MEDIA-TYPES]:

340	   *  Type name: application
341	   *  Subtype name: geofeed+csv
342	   *  Required parameters: N/A
343	   *  Optional parameters: "charset" is an optional parameter for "text/
344	      csv", but it is not used for "application/geofeed+csv" because the
345	      geofeed content is always in UTF-8 (Section 2.1 of [RFC8805]).
346	   *  Encoding considerations: See Section 2 of [RFC9632].
347	   *  Security considerations: See Section 5 of this document.
348	   *  Interoperability considerations: There are no known
349	      interoperability problems regarding this media format.

352	      Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) Extension for Geofeed
353	      Data.  Furthermore, any application that processes the CSV geofeed
354	      data.
355	   *  Additional information: This media type is a product of the IETF
356	      REGEXT Working Group.  The REGEXT charter, information on the
357	      REGEXT mailing list, and other documents produced by the REGEXT
358	      Working Group can be found at [REGEXT].

366	   *  Provisional Registration: No

368	6.4.  Structured Syntax Suffixes Registry

370	   IANA is requested to register the following value in the Structured
371	   Syntax Suffixes Registry at [STRUCTURED-SYNTAX-SUFFIXES]:

373	   *  Name: Comma-Separated Values (CSV)

375	   *  +suffix: +csv

377	   *  References: [RFC4180], [RFC7111]

379	   *  Encoding Considerations: Same as "text/csv".

381	   *  Interoperability Considerations: Same as "text/csv".

383	   *  Fragment Identifier Considerations:

385	      The syntax and semantics of fragment identifiers specified for
386	      +csv SHOULD be as specified for "text/csv".

388	      The syntax and semantics for fragment identifiers for a specific
389	      "xxx/yyy+csv" SHOULD be processed as follows:

391	      For cases defined in +csv, where the fragment identifier resolves
392	      per the +csv rules, then as specified for +csv.

394	      For cases defined in +csv, where the fragment identifier does not
395	      resolve per the +csv rules, then as specified for "xxx/yyy+csv".

397	      For cases not defined in +csv, then as specified for "xxx/
398	      yyy+csv".

400	   *  Security Considerations: Same as "text/csv".

406	7.  Implementation Status

408	   (Remove this section before publication.)
409	   This section records the status of known implementations of the
410	   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
411	   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
412	   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
413	   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
414	   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
415	   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
416	   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
417	   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
418	   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
419	   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
420	   exist.

422	   According to RFC 7942, "this will allow reviewers and working groups
423	   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
424	   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
425	   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
426	   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
427	   they see fit".

443	   Mark Kosters provided initial support and encouragement for this
444	   work, along with the [RFC9632] authors.  Gavin Brown suggested using
445	   a web link instead of a simple URL string to specify a geofeed file
446	   URL.  Andy Newton, James Gould, Scott Hollenbeck, Mario Loffredo,
447	   Orie Steele, Alexey Melnikov, Mark Nottingham, Rifaat Shekh-Yusuf,

451	9.  Change History

453	   (Remove this section before publication.)

455	9.1.  Changes from 00 to 01
456	   *  Now using a web link instead of a simple URL string to specify a
457	      geofeed file URL.
458	   *  Renamed the extension as "geofeed1" instead of "geofeedv1".
459	   *  Introduced the new "geo" link relation type.
460	   *  Introduced the new "application/geofeed+csv" media type.

462	9.2.  Changes from 01 to 02

464	   *  Updated the "Requirements Language" section for examples.
465	   *  Added an example for RDAP conformance.
466	   *  Updated the rationale for using the new "application/geofeed+csv"
467	      media type.
468	   *  Updated the "Applications that use this media type" section for
469	      the "application/geofeed+csv" registration.

471	9.3.  Changes from 02 to 03

473	   *  Removed "value" and "hreflang" explanations from the "Geofeed
474	      Link" section.  Further, clarified the cardinality of geofeed link
475	      objects.
476	   *  Updated extensibility verbiage in the "Media Type for a Geofeed
477	      Link" section.
478	   *  In the "Example" section, updated the domain in "href" of the
479	      geofeed link object to contrast with the domain in "value" to
480	      highlight that "href" is for a geofeed file hosted at a network
481	      operator site whereas "value" is for an IP network object from an
482	      RDAP server.
483	   *  Removed the "Redaction" section since the geofeed files are public
484	      to start with.
485	   *  Added URLs for various IANA registries.

487	9.4.  Changes from 03 to 04

489	   *  Updated the criteria for including the extension identifier in
490	      "rdapConformance".

492	9.5.  Changes from 04 to 05

494	   *  Made various editorial changes.

496	9.6.  Changes from 05 to 06

498	   *  The extension identifier inclusion is now a must.
499	   *  Added the "Operational Considerations" section to clarify the
500	      geofeed file and IP networks relationship, as well as how RDAP
501	      Bootstrap helps with a recommendation from RFC 8805.
502	   *  Updated the "Privacy Considerations" section to clarify the
503	      service provider responsibility.

505	9.7.  Changes from 06 to 07

507	   *  Updated the extension identifier text so as to clarify that the
508	      media type and link relation can be used independently of that
509	      identifier.

511	9.8.  Changes from 07 to 08

513	   *  Added the "Implementation Status" section.
514	   *  Updated references.

516	9.9.  Changes from 08 to 09

518	   *  Incorporated feedback from the AD review.
519	   *  Incorporated feedback from the media type review.
520	   *  RFCs 4180, 7111, and 8805 are now normative references.
521	   *  Made minor editorial changes.

523	9.10.  Changes from 09 to 10

525	   *  Incorporated feedback from the IESG review.

527	9.11.  Changes from 10 to 11

529	   *  Incorporated feedback from the IESG review.

531	9.12.  Changes from 11 to 12

533	   *  Incorporated feedback from the IESG review.
