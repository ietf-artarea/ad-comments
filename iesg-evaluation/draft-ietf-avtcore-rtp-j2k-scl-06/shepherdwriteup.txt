# Document Shepherd Write-Up for Group Documents

*This version is dated 4 July 2022.*

Thank you for your service as a document shepherd. Among the responsibilities is
answering the questions in this write-up to give helpful context to Last Call
and Internet Engineering Steering Group ([IESG][1]) reviewers, and your
diligence in completing it is appreciated. The full role of the shepherd is
further described in [<a href="/doc/rfc4858/">RFC 4858</a>][2]. You will need the cooperation of the authors
and editors to complete these checks.

Note that some numbered items contain multiple related questions; please be sure
to answer all of them.

## Document History

1. Does the working group (WG) consensus represent the strong concurrence of a
few individuals, with others being silent, or did it reach broad agreement?
The document was initially submitted in September 2023. It was revised a few
times based on feedback received. Within the WG, the document was driven by a
few individuals with indication of support from several others on the mailing
list, including:
<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/avt/3MqgtbTZ0UyetwDRXbNVv1uZVEE/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/avt/3MqgtbTZ0UyetwDRXbNVv1uZVEE/</a>
<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/avt/XTWN9lnTIjyTjAPuzncacN6P2QA/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/avt/XTWN9lnTIjyTjAPuzncacN6P2QA/</a>
<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/avt/YLomFkWsItV5eWYFxg2hJ1QHCa8/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/avt/YLomFkWsItV5eWYFxg2hJ1QHCa8/</a>
<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/avt/0O67w7qPt71llIIFkCGBkV3eKqQ/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/avt/0O67w7qPt71llIIFkCGBkV3eKqQ/</a>
<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/avt/6QDBymvd08UAEzhm-Ix77MWs36U/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/avt/6QDBymvd08UAEzhm-Ix77MWs36U/</a>
<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/avt/Xdu7Re-2IO1jf1vQau0jMqWVRkg/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/avt/Xdu7Re-2IO1jf1vQau0jMqWVRkg/</a>
<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/avt/XoT5fqj0NkXZtut-iTNI5ozMr5Q/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/avt/XoT5fqj0NkXZtut-iTNI5ozMr5Q/</a>

2. Was there controversy about particular points, or were there decisions where
the consensus was particularly rough?
No significant controversy arose.

3. Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If
so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the
responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this
questionnaire is publicly available.)
No extreme discontent was expressed.

4. For protocol documents, are there existing implementations of the contents of
the document? Have a significant number of potential implementers indicated
plans to implement? Are any existing implementations reported somewhere,
either in the document itself (as [<a href="/doc/rfc7942/">RFC 7942</a>][3] recommends) or elsewhere
(where)?
The protocol is implemented in the Kakadu Software SDK
(<a href="https://kakadusoftware.com/">https://kakadusoftware.com/</a>) and the OpenJPH open-source library
(<a href="https://github.com/aous72/OpenJPH">https://github.com/aous72/OpenJPH</a>). Osamu Watanabe (Takushoku University) and
Shigetaka Ogawa (ICT Link) are developing another implementation.

## Additional Reviews

5. Do the contents of this document closely interact with technologies in other
IETF working groups or external organizations, and would it therefore benefit
from their review? Have those reviews occurred? If yes, describe which
reviews took place.
The contents of the document are a straightforward application of the RTP
transport protocol (<a href="/doc/rfc3550/">RFC 3550</a>), which is maintained by the AVT Core WG, to the
JPEG 2000 image codec, which is maintained by ISO, IEC and ITU.

6. Describe how the document meets any required formal expert review criteria,
such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.
The jpeg2000-scl RTP Payload Format Media Type defined in Section 9 will be
submitted for registration with IANA in accordance with <a href="/doc/rfc4855/">RFC 4855</a>.  The shepherd
reviewed the proposed registration and believed it follows the newest template
and is complete and reasonable.  A review request was sent to the media-types
list on 2/19/25, with reminders sent on 2/28/25 and 3/13/25.  As of 3/17/25, no
replies have been forthcoming.

7. If the document contains a YANG module, has the final version of the module
been checked with any of the [recommended validation tools][4] for syntax and
formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is
the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module
comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified
in [<a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC 8342</a>][5]?

The document does not specify a YANG module.

8. Describe reviews and automated checks performed to validate sections of the
final version of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code,
BNF rules, MIB definitions, CBOR's CDDL, etc.
The document contains only one trivial ANBF definition, which was checked using
the ABNF Tools provided at IETF Author Tools.

## Document Shepherd Checks

9. Based on the shepherd's review of the document, is it their opinion that this
document is needed, clearly written, complete, correctly designed, and ready
to be handed off to the responsible Area Director?
Yes. The existence of multiple implementations both reduces the risk of
egregious errors and suggests community interest.

10. Several IETF Areas have assembled [lists of common issues that their
reviewers encounter][6]. For which areas have such issues been identified
and addressed? For which does this still need to happen in subsequent
reviews?
The lists were reviewed. No issues have been identified.

11. What type of RFC publication is being requested on the IETF stream ([Best
Current Practice][12], [Proposed Standard, Internet Standard][13],
[Informational, Experimental or Historic][14])? Why is this the proper type
of RFC? Do all Datatracker state attributes correctly reflect this intent?
Publication as Proposed Standard is requested. The document defines the
streaming of a video signal and is intended to be implemented by a diversity of
senders and receivers. Interoperability between an arbitrary sender and
receiver require both to strongly agree on syntax, semantics and operations.

12. Have reasonable efforts been made to remind all authors of the intellectual
property rights (IPR) disclosure obligations described in [<a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a>][7]? To
the best of your knowledge, have all required disclosures been filed? If
not, explain why. If yes, summarize any relevant discussion, including links
to publicly-available messages when applicable.
A call for <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP79</a> compliance and authorship willingness was made on 12/9/2024:
<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/avt/uz1cZfsI1trYM-H7RPlSyJj0cGw/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/avt/uz1cZfsI1trYM-H7RPlSyJj0cGw/</a> Both
authors responded positively: Pierre-Anthony Lemieux responded positively on
12/11/2024:
<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/avt/KAb9DGM4JUQSn5gEwGRRu6kNUgs/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/avt/KAb9DGM4JUQSn5gEwGRRu6kNUgs/</a> David
Taubman also responded positively the call, but for reasons unknown his
response doensâ€™t show up in the mailing list archives.  The document shepherd
forwarded one of his emails to the reflector on 1/18/2025:
<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/avt/1WXK1-36sMxfeLwsIJPTuCjQi3M/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/avt/1WXK1-36sMxfeLwsIJPTuCjQi3M/</a>

13. Has each author, editor, and contributor shown their willingness to be
listed as such? If the total number of authors and editors on the front page
is greater than five, please provide a justification.
Each author has indicated their willingness to be listed as an author.   See
Q.12 for links.

14. Document any remaining I-D nits in this document. Simply running the [idnits
tool][8] is not enough; please review the ["Content Guidelines" on
<a href="http://authors.ietf.org">authors.ietf.org</a>][15]. (Also note that the current idnits tool generates
some incorrect warnings; a rewrite is underway.)
No nits are outstanding.

15. Should any informative references be normative or vice-versa? See the [IESG
Statement on Normative and Informative References][16].
No.

16. List any normative references that are not freely available to anyone. Did
the community have sufficient access to review any such normative
references?
At least one version of all normative references is available freely.  (JPEG
2000 is available from ISO for a fee, but technically identical text is
available from the ITU free of charge.)

17. Are there any normative downward references (see [<a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>][9] and [<a href="/doc/bcp97/">BCP
97</a>][10]) that are not already listed in the [DOWNREF registry][17]? If so,
list them.
N/A

18. Are there normative references to documents that are not ready to be
submitted to the IESG for publication or are otherwise in an unclear state?
If so, what is the plan for their completion?
N/A

19. Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? If
so, does the Datatracker metadata correctly reflect this and are those RFCs
listed on the title page, in the abstract, and discussed in the
introduction? If not, explain why and point to the part of the document
where the relationship of this document to these other RFCs is discussed.
N/A

20. Describe the document shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section,
especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document.
Confirm that all aspects of the document requiring IANA assignments are
associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm
that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm
that each newly created IANA registry specifies its initial contents,
allocations procedures, and a reasonable name (see [<a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>][11]).
The document contains RTP payload format media type registration request.  The
shepherd reviewed the proposed registration and believes it follows the newest
template and is complete and reasonable.  A review request was sent to the
media-types list on 2/19/25, with reminders sent on 2/28/25 and 3/13/25.  As of
3/17/25, no replies have been forthcoming.

21. List any new IANA registries that require Designated Expert Review for
future allocations. Are the instructions to the Designated Expert clear?
Please include suggestions of designated experts, if appropriate.
