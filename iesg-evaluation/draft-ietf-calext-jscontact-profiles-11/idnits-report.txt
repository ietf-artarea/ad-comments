14	   subsets of JSContact elements.  It aims to facilitate using JSContact
15	   in context of contact data exchange protocols or other use cases, in
16	   which supporting all of JSContact semantics might be inappropriate.

83	2.  Introduction

85	   The JSContact [RFC9553] contact card data model and format is
86	   designed for use in address book applications and directory services.
87	   Intended as an alternative to the prevalent vCard [RFC6350] data
88	   format, it covers vCard core semantics and extensions, and provides a
89	   rich model for personal names, postal addresses and localization.
90	   All JSContact elements are relevant for some contact card use case
91	   and, similar to vCard, implementations are expected to support these
92	   elements when exchanging contact card information using protocols
93	   such as CardDAV [RFC6352] and JMAP for Contacts [RFC9610].

95	   In contrast, other protocols and internet standards might require
96	   exchanging _some_ contact card information, but not all of what
97	   JSContact provides.  Section 1.7.4 of [RFC9553] outlines how
98	   JSContact implementations may ignore unknown JSContact elements, but

100	RFC draft-ietf-calext-jsconJSContactiProfiles              December 2025

102	   this only applies to future extensions of [RFC9553]; they are still
103	   expected to implement all elements of the core specification.  Also,
104	   the extensibility of JSContact and the requirement to preserve
105	   arbitrary contact elements might not be adequate for some protocols.

107	   To make use of JSContact under these circumstances, this document
108	   defines a new IANA registry for JSContact that allows for registering
109	   named subsets of JSContact elements.  These subsets are referred to
110	   as "JSContact profiles" and are meant to bring the following
111	   benefits:

113	   *  Protocol designers might be encouraged to use JSContact, rather
114	      than coming up with their own contacts format.  This facilitates
115	      cross-protocol data exchange and migration.

117	   *  Different protocols use the same IANA registry to express which
118	      JSContact elements they support.  This facilitates understanding
119	      their commonalities and reusing existing profiles.

121	   *  A central registry provides implementors of JSContact libraries
122	      with a consistent format documenting which profile supports what
123	      elements, rather than having to look up that information from
124	      possibly distinctly organized internet drafts.

126	   This document is organized as follows: Section 3 defines JSContact
127	   profiles, Section 4 illustrates JSContact profiles by example,
128	   Section 5 summarizes the relevant information for IANA to establish
129	   the JSContact Profiles registry.

131	3.  JSContact Profiles

133	   A JSContact profile is a named and versioned set of JSContact
134	   properties, value types and values.  These JSContact elements MAY be
135	   further restricted by the profile, but a profile can not loosen
136	   restrictions.  For example, a profile can define an originally
137	   optional property to become mandatory, but it can not make a
138	   mandatory property become optional.

140	   The JSContact elements MUST be registered in the IANA JSContact
141	   registry.  A JSContact extension MAY define both a new profile and
142	   new properties or other elements, as long as they are registered at
143	   the same time.  A JSContact profile MUST be registered at IANA (see
144	   Section 5).  Section 3.1 defines how to name a JSContact profile,
145	   Section 3.2 defines how to version it, Section 3.3 defines how to
146	   specify the properties supported by that profile.

148	RFC draft-ietf-calext-jsconJSContactiProfiles              December 2025

150	   A JSContact object complies with a profile if all its properties are
151	   in the set of properties defined by that profile and the property
152	   values comply with the profile restrictions for that property.  A
153	   JSContact object can comply with multiple profiles, even with
154	   profiles that weren't defined at the time when the JSContact data was
155	   created.  Accordingly, this document does not specify any means for
156	   JSContact data to communicate which profiles it complies with, e.g.
157	   it does not define a "profile" property for the Card object.

159	   All properties and values of a JSContact object that complies with a
160	   profile MUST also be valid (Section 1.7 of [RFC9553]).  Handling
161	   JSContact data that is valid but that does not comply with the
162	   expected profile is protocol-specific.  This document deliberately
163	   does not define such non-compliant data as _invalid_. Profile
164	   designers decide on their own strategies for handling non-compliant
165	   data, one of which may be to reject it as invalid.  JSContact data
166	   that complies with a profile may still not be valid in the context of
167	   that protocol; the protocol specification MAY define additional
168	   restrictions that a profile cannot express.

170	3.1.  Profile Name

172	   A JSContact profile has a unique name.  The name MUST only contain
173	   ASCII lowercase alphabetic and numeric characters, optionally
174	   separated by hyphens.  It MUST start with an alphabetic character and
175	   it MUST be of at least 1 character and at most 255 characters in
176	   size.  Formally, it MUST be a valid "profile-name" defined in
177	   Figure 1.

179	   profile-name = LALPHA *( ["-"] LALPHA / DIGIT )
180	                  ; at most 255 octets in size

182	   LALPHA       = %x61-7A ; a-z

184	               Figure 1: ABNF Rule for JSContact Profile Name

186	3.2.  Profile Version

188	   A JSContact profile has a current version, each profile is versioned
189	   independently.  The version MUST be a positive integer and it MUST
190	   increase whenever the profile properties (Section 3.3) change.  The
191	   inital version value is 1.

193	   If this versioning scheme is not adequate for protocol designers
194	   making use of JSContact profiles, then an alternative approach is to
195	   register a new JSContact profile for each new version.

197	RFC draft-ietf-calext-jsconJSContactiProfiles              December 2025

199	3.3.  Profile Properties

201	   A profile defines a list of property entries that together determine
202	   the set of properties supported by that profile, as described in
203	   Section 3.4.  The list MUST NOT be empty.

205	   Each property entry consists of the following elements:

207	   Property Name:  This is the name of the JSContact property that this
208	      entry refers to.  This MUST be a property name registered in the
209	      "JSContact Properties" registry.  A property name MAY occur
210	      multiple times in the property entry list if the profile-specific
211	      restrictions for that property can not be expressed with a single
212	      entry, but such multiple entries MUST NOT result in conflicting
213	      restrictions for the same property.  This field MUST NOT be empty.

215	   Property Context:  This is a comma-separated list of JSContact object
216	      types that support this property in this profile.  Each of these
217	      types MUST also be listed in the property contexts for this
218	      property in the "JSContact Properties" registry, but a profile MAY
219	      only support the property in a subset of these contexts.  This
220	      field MUST NOT be empty.

222	   Restricted Attributes:  This restricts the attributes of the
223	      property.  This specification only defines how to restrict the
224	      attributes such that a property becomes mandatory in the listed
225	      property contexts, despite the property originally being defined
226	      to be optional in the same contexts.  The verbatim value
227	      "mandatory" (without quotes) indicates that it is mandatory in
228	      this profile, the absence of any value indicates that this profile
229	      does not restrict the property attributes of the original
230	      definition.

232	   Restricted Property Type:  This restricts the property value type in
233	      the listed property contexts, even though the property was
234	      originally defined with a less restrictive type definition.  If
235	      set, the original value type MUST contain some type signature in
236	      form "A|B" and the restricted value type MUST resemble the
237	      original except that some of the original "A|B" forms now only
238	      allow a subset of the original choices.  Restricted property types
239	      can not redefine the "defaultType" attribute [RFC9553]
240	      (Section 1.3.3), the rules when to set the "@type" property
241	      [RFC9553] (Section 1.3.4) of the original type definition still
242	      apply.

244	      For example, one might want to restrict the "date" property of the
245	      Anniversary object to only allow partial dates as values.  To do
246	      so, the original value type "PartialDate|Timestamp" can be

248	RFC draft-ietf-calext-jsconJSContactiProfiles              December 2025

250	      restricted to "PartialDate".  Note that the original value type
251	      need not be exactly in form "A|B".  For example, the type
252	      signature "Id[A|B|C]" could be restricted to any of "Id[A|B]",
253	      "Id[A|C]", "Id[B|C]", "Id[A]", "Id[B]", "Id[C]", and the type
254	      signature "(A|B)[]" to one of "A[]" or "B[]".

256	   Restricted Enum Values:  This restricts the enumerated values defined
257	      for this property to a subset of those values.  The values MUST be
258	      listed in the "JSContact Enum Values" registry for this property
259	      and context.  Allowed values are separated by comma; the absence
260	      of any value indicates that all enumerated values are allowed.  A
261	      profile MAY exclude the default enumerated value of a property, in
262	      which case all instances of the object MUST have this property set
263	      to one of the allowed values.

265	   Restricted PatchObject:  This restricts the PatchObject value of this
266	      property such that each JSON Pointer key in the PatchObject MUST
267	      consist of exactly one JSON Pointer reference token [RFC6901]
268	      (Section 3).  For example, with this restriction the
269	      "localizations" property of the Card object can only patch
270	      properties of the Card object by replacing their values entirely.
271	      The verbatim value "yes" (without quotes) indicates that this
272	      profile restricts PatchObject keys to a single token; the absence
273	      of any value indicates that it does not restrict them.  This MUST
274	      NOT be set to "yes" if the property value type is not a
275	      PatchObject.

277	   All profiles MUST support "@type" and "version", and therefore
278	   profiles MUST NOT include entries for these properties.

280	3.4.  Supported Properties

282	   The supported properties of a JSContact profile are determined by the
283	   profile's property entries and the contents of the IANA "JSContact
284	   Properties" registry, which is here referred to as "IANA-registered
285	   properties" for short.  The "version" property of the Card object and
286	   the "@type" property of any object type are always supported.

288	   A Card object complies with the profile if all its properties are
289	   part of the supported properties and all property values are valid
290	   according to the restrictions defined in the applicable property
291	   entries.  A PatchObject MUST NOT patch properties that are not
292	   supported in that profile.

294	   The following describes the steps to determine the supported
295	   properties:

297	RFC draft-ietf-calext-jsconJSContactiProfiles              December 2025

299	   1.  Initialize the set with all properties of the Card object for
300	       which a property entry contains "Card" in the Property Context of
301	       the profile.  If no such entry exists then initialize the set
302	       with all IANA-registered properties of the Card object.

304	   2.  For every property in the set having either an object type as
305	       value type, or a list or map or union of object types, add all
306	       properties for which a property entry contains those object types
307	       in the Property Context of the profile.  If no such property
308	       entry exists then add all IANA-registered properties for the
309	       object types.

311	   3.  Repeat the previous step until all object types that are value
312	       types of properties in the set have been considered.

314	   Appendix A describes how to determine the supported properties of the
315	   example profile in Section 4.

317	4.  Example Profile

319	   This section provides an example for a JSContact profile and
320	   illustrates how a JSContact Card complies with that profile.
321	   Appendix A describes how to determine the supported properties for
322	   that profile.  The example profile is defined the same as if it would
323	   be registered in the IANA JSContact Profiles registry.  See Section 5
324	   for the exact meaning of each registry item.  This profile is just
325	   for illustration, it is not registered at IANA.

327	   The following assignments would be registered at IANA if this were a
328	   real profile:

330	   Name:
331	      jscontact-simple

333	   Version:
334	      1

336	   Reference:
337	      This document, Table 1

339	   The following table defines the properties of that profile.  This
340	   profile does not specify any "Restricted Property Type" and the
341	   according column is omitted.

370	           Table 1: Properties of the "jscontact-simple" profile

372	   This profile describes contact cards that can only contain:

374	   *  Contact cards for individuals and organizations, but no other
375	      kinds such as groups or devices.

377	   *  Full postal address lines, but no address components or any other
378	      property of the Address object type.

380	   *  Full names and name components, but no other properties of the
381	      Name object type.

383	   *  Email addresses, where all properties of the EmailAddress object
384	      are supported.

386	   *  Localizations, with the restriction that the PatchObject must only
387	      patch properties of the Card object.

389	   The following Card object complies with the example profile:

401	     },
402	     "addresses": {
403	       "a1": {
404	         "full": "71 Cherry Court, Somewhere, 123SO, UK"
405	       }
406	     },
407	     "emails": {
408	       "e1": {
409	         "address": "hayao@example.com"
410	       }

417	            { "kind": "given", "value": "駿" }
418	           ]
419	         }
420	       }
421	     }
422	   }

424	   Note that:

426	   *  The Address, Card, Name, and NameComponent object values only
427	      contain properties for which a property entry exists in the
428	      profile.

430	   *  The EmailAddress object contains the "address" property.  This is
431	      allowed because the profile contains a property entry for the
432	      "emails" property of the Card object, but it does not define
433	      entries for the EmailAddress object properties.  Consequently, all
434	      properties of the EmailAddress object can be set.

436	   *  The "full" property of the Address object is set.  It is the only
437	      property allowed to be set in that profile for Address, and the
438	      "full" property is mandatory for this profile.

440	RFC draft-ietf-calext-jsconJSContactiProfiles              December 2025

442	   *  The "kind" property of the the NameComponent objects is set to
443	      "surname" and "given", respectively.  Since the profile does not
444	      restrict the enumerated values of this property, all valid
445	      NameComponent "kind" property values are supported.

447	   *  The "kind" property of the Card object is not set.  The profile
448	      restricts the enumerated values of this property to "individual"
449	      and "org".  Since "individual" is the default value for this
450	      property, there is no need to set it.

452	5.  IANA Considerations

454	5.1.  Creation of the JSContact Profile Registry

456	   IANA will add the "JSContact Profile" registry to the "JSContact"
457	   registry group.  The purpose of this new registry is to register
458	   profiles for JSContact data.  The registry policy to add a new
459	   profile to this registry is "Specification Required", while the
460	   registry policy to update an existing profile is "Expert Review".
461	   The change controller is IETF.

463	   Designated experts assert that all proposed assignments are valid
464	   according to the definitions in this document, e.g. they check that
465	   the profile name is unique, that the entries in the profile entries
466	   are syntactically valid, that only known property names are referred
467	   to, that type restrictions do not incorrectly alter the type of a
468	   property, and that the version number increases.  On the other hand,
469	   designated experts do not decide the contents of the profile as long
470	   as the assignments are valid.

472	   An entry in this registry consists of the following assignments, all
473	   of which MUST be set:

475	   Name:
476	      This is the name of the profile.  This field is immutable after
477	      creation.  The name MUST be unique among all registered profiles
478	      and MUST comply with the definitions in Section 3.1.

480	   Version:
481	      This is the version number of the profile.  It MUST comply with
482	      the definitions in Section 3.2.

484	   Reference:
485	      This refers to the specifications of the protocol or use case for
486	      which this profile applies.  The reference MUST must include the
487	      section number or name that defines or updates the property
488	      entries for this profile, as defined in Section 3.3.

490	RFC draft-ietf-calext-jsconJSContactiProfiles              December 2025

492	5.2.  Initial Contents of the JSContact Profile Registry

494	   This document does not define any initial contents for the newly
495	   created registries.

497	6.  Security Considerations

499	   This document does not provide new security considerations.  The
500	   security considerations of Section 4 of [RFC9553] apply.

547	Appendix A.  Supported Properties Example

549	   The following illustrates how to determine the supported properties
550	   of the example profile (Section 4), according to the steps defined in
551	   Section 3.4:

553	   1.  We initialize the set of supported properties with all profile
554	       properties for which the property context includes the "Card"
555	       object.  The set now includes the properties:

557	       *  Card.addresses

559	       *  Card.emails

561	       *  Card.kind

563	       *  Card.localizations

565	       *  Card.name

567	   2.  Next, we determine which of the properties in the current set
568	       have an object type as value type.  These are the "Card.address",
569	       "Card.emails" and "Card.name" properties, so we need to inspect
570	       the object types "Address", "EmailAddress" and "Name".

572	   3.  For the "Address" object type, the profile has an entry for the
573	       "full" property which contains the "Address" object in the
574	       Property Context, so we add that and only that to the set of
575	       supported properties.  It now contains:

577	       *  Address.full

579	       *  Card.addresses

581	       *  Card.emails

583	       *  Card.kind

585	       *  Card.localizations

587	       *  Card.name

589	RFC draft-ietf-calext-jsconJSContactiProfiles              December 2025

591	       The value type of the "Address.full" property is not an object
592	       type, so we need not consider a new object type to inspect.  The
593	       remaining object types to inspect are the "EmailAddress" and
594	       "Name" objects.

596	   4.  For the "EmailAddress" object type, the profile does not contain
597	       any entry where the Property Context contains the "EmailAddress"
598	       object.  Instead, we add properties of the "JSContact Properties"
599	       registry where the property context includes the "EmailAddress"
600	       object.  The set of supported properties now contains:

602	       *  Address.full

604	       *  Card.addresses

606	       *  Card.emails

608	       *  Card.kind

610	       *  Card.localizations

612	       *  Card.name

614	       *  EmailAddress.address

616	       *  EmailAddress.contexts

618	       *  EmailAddress.label

620	       *  EmailAddress.pref

622	       None of the newly added properties have object value types.  The
623	       remaining object type to inspect is the "Name" object.

625	   5.  For the "Name" object type, the profile explicitly lists the
626	       "components" and "full" properties, so we add them to the set of
627	       supported properties.  It now contains:

629	       *  Address.full

631	       *  Card.addresses

633	       *  Card.emails

635	       *  Card.kind

637	       *  Card.localizations

639	RFC draft-ietf-calext-jsconJSContactiProfiles              December 2025

641	       *  Card.name

643	       *  EmailAddress.address

645	       *  EmailAddress.contexts

647	       *  EmailAddress.label

649	       *  EmailAddress.pref

651	       *  Name.full

653	       *  Name.components

655	       The newly added Name.components property has object value type
656	       "NameComponent", so we add that to the list of object types to
657	       inspect.

659	   6.  For the "NameComponent" object type, the profile does not
660	       explicitly list any property.  Instead, we add properties of the
661	       "JSContact Properties" registry where the property context
662	       includes the "NameComponent" object.  The set of supported
663	       properties now contains:

665	       *  Address.full

667	       *  Card.addresses

669	       *  Card.emails

671	       *  Card.kind

673	       *  Card.localizations

675	       *  Card.name

677	       *  EmailAddress.address

679	       *  EmailAddress.contexts

681	       *  EmailAddress.label

683	       *  EmailAddress.pref

685	       *  NameComponent.kind

687	       *  NameComponent.phonetic

689	RFC draft-ietf-calext-jsconJSContactiProfiles              December 2025

691	       *  NameComponent.value

693	       None of the newly added properties have object value types and
694	       there are no remaining object types to inspect.  This determines
695	       the set of supported properties by that profile, in addition to
696	       the "Card.version" and "@type" property that are always
697	       supported.
