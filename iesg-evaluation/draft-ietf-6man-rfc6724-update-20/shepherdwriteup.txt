## Document History

1. Does the working group (WG) consensus represent the strong concurrence of a
few individuals, with others being silent, or did it reach broad agreement?

The document has been actively discussed in the WG mailing list and during 6MAN
sessions, with many participants expressing their opinions, comments and
suggestions.

2. Was there controversy about particular points, or were there decisions where
the consensus was particularly rough?

While some topic (such as processing PIOs advertized by SNAC routers and
what prefix length to use for known-local ULAs) caused very active discussions
on the list and resulted in significant changes to the document, all issues
were resolved to everyone's satisfaction.

3. Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If
so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the
responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this
questionnaire is publicly available.)

No.

4. For protocol documents, are there existing implementations of the contents of
the document? Have a significant number of potential implementers indicated
plans to implement? Are any existing implementations reported somewhere,
either in the document itself (as [<a href="/doc/rfc7942/">RFC 7942</a>][3] recommends) or elsewhere
(where)?

There are two implementations of the proposed changes to <a href="/doc/rfc6724/">RFC6724</a>:

- Android implements the proposed changes to insert "known-local" ULAs into the
policy table: <a href="https://r.android.com/3046000">https://r.android.com/3046000</a> - The authors created a
proof-of-concept implementation, available at
<a href="https://github.com/jeremy-duncan/raio_ula">https://github.com/jeremy-duncan/raio_ula</a>

Those details are also reported in The "Implementation Status" section of the
document.

## Additional Reviews

5. Do the contents of this document closely interact with technologies in other
IETF working groups or external organizations, and would it therefore benefit
from their review? Have those reviews occurred? If yes, describe which
reviews took place.

The document doesn't impact/interact with technologies in other WGs/orgs.

6. Describe how the document meets any required formal expert review criteria,
such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.

N/A

7. If the document contains a YANG module, has the final version of the module
been checked with any of the [recommended validation tools][4] for syntax and
formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is
the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module
comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified
in [<a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC 8342</a>][5]?

The document contains no YANG modules.

8. Describe reviews and automated checks performed to validate sections of the
final version of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code,
BNF rules, MIB definitions, CBOR's CDDL, etc.

The document contains no such sections.

## Document Shepherd Checks

9. Based on the shepherd's review of the document, is it their opinion that this
document is needed, clearly written, complete, correctly designed, and ready
to be handed off to the responsible Area Director?

Absolutely!
The document introduces very useful tweaks for the default address selection
algorithm. With the proposed changes, ULAs can actually become useful and pave
the road for IPv6 adopton in enterprise-like networks.

10. Several IETF Areas have assembled [lists of common issues that their
reviewers encounter][6]. For which areas have such issues been identified
and addressed? For which does this still need to happen in subsequent
reviews?

No issues have been identified for the document.

11. What type of RFC publication is being requested on the IETF stream ([Best
Current Practice][12], [Proposed Standard, Internet Standard][13],
[Informational, Experimental or Historic][14])? Why is this the proper type
of RFC? Do all Datatracker state attributes correctly reflect this intent?

Proposed Standard, which is the proper type: this document updates <a href="/doc/rfc6724/">RFC6724</a>
(standard track).

12. Have reasonable efforts been made to remind all authors of the intellectual
property rights (IPR) disclosure obligations described in [<a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a>][7]? To
the best of your knowledge, have all required disclosures been filed? If
not, explain why. If yes, summarize any relevant discussion, including links
to publicly-available messages when applicable.

The authors are not aware of any IPRs:
<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ipv6/9O51DA2JWaOWLtuefscdvp-MLoc/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ipv6/9O51DA2JWaOWLtuefscdvp-MLoc/</a>

13. Has each author, editor, and contributor shown their willingness to be
listed as such? If the total number of authors and editors on the front page
is greater than five, please provide a justification.

The document has 3 authors, and all of them are willing to be listed as such:
<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ipv6/9O51DA2JWaOWLtuefscdvp-MLoc/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ipv6/9O51DA2JWaOWLtuefscdvp-MLoc/</a>

14. Document any remaining I-D nits in this document. Simply running the [idnits
tool][8] is not enough; please review the ["Content Guidelines" on
<a href="http://authors.ietf.org">authors.ietf.org</a>][15]. (Also note that the current idnits tool generates
some incorrect warnings; a rewrite is underway.)

All other idnits issues on -17 are false positives.

No issues listed in the "Content Guidelines" have been identified.

15. Should any informative references be normative or vice-versa? See the [IESG
Statement on Normative and Informative References][16].

No. During the shepherd's review of -16 all such references were identified and
fixed.

16. List any normative references that are not freely available to anyone. Did
the community have sufficient access to review any such normative
references?

No such references.

17. Are there any normative downward references (see [<a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>][9] and [<a href="/doc/bcp97/">BCP
97</a>][10]) that are not already listed in the [DOWNREF registry][17]? If so,
list them.

See below (#18)

18. Are there normative references to documents that are not ready to be
submitted to the IESG for publication or are otherwise in an unclear state?
If so, what is the plan for their completion?

The document refers to a new RA flag defined in
draft-ietf-6man-snac-router-ra-flag. <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-6man-snac-router-ra-flag/">draft-ietf-6man-snac-router-ra-flag</a> is in
the RFC editors queue waiting for <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-snac-simple/">draft-ietf-snac-simple</a> to be submitted for
the publication, so there is a dependency here. <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-snac-simple/">draft-ietf-snac-simple</a> is
expected to enter the WGLC soon.

19. Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? If
so, does the Datatracker metadata correctly reflect this and are those RFCs
listed on the title page, in the abstract, and discussed in the
introduction? If not, explain why and point to the part of the document
where the relationship of this document to these other RFCs is discussed.

Yes, this document updated <a href="/doc/rfc6724/">RFC6724</a>, which is reflected in the document metadata.

20. Describe the document shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section,
especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document.
Confirm that all aspects of the document requiring IANA assignments are
associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm
that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm
that each newly created IANA registry specifies its initial contents,
allocations procedures, and a reasonable name (see [<a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>][11]).

This document doesn't introduce any IANA considerations.

21. List any new IANA registries that require Designated Expert Review for
future allocations. Are the instructions to the Designated Expert clear?
Please include suggestions of designated experts, if appropriate.
