# Document Shepherd Write-Up for &quot;Cross-Device Flows: Security Best Current Practice&quot;

URL: <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-cross-device-security-12">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-cross-device-security-12</a>

## Document History

1. Does the working group (WG) consensus represent the strong concurrence of a
few individuals, with others being silent, or did it reach broad agreement?

Yes.

2. Was there controversy about particular points, or were there decisions where
the consensus was particularly rough?

No.

3. Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If
so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the
responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this
questionnaire is publicly available.)

No.

4. For protocol documents, are there existing implementations of the contents of
the document? Have a significant number of potential implementers indicated
plans to implement? Are any existing implementations reported somewhere,
either in the document itself (as [<a href="/doc/rfc7942/">RFC 7942</a>][3] recommends) or elsewhere
(where)?

Participants on the list reported that several companies have implemented
different mitigations described in the draft. Examples include:

- Okta
- SPIRL
- AWS
- Microsoft
- FusionAuth

Additionally, the proximity check outlined in the draft is what the W3C Digitial
Credentials API &lt;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/digital-credentials/&gt;">https://www.w3.org/TR/digital-credentials/&gt;</a> is doing to
secure cross-device flows.


## Additional Reviews

5. Do the contents of this document closely interact with technologies in other
IETF working groups or external organizations, and would it therefore benefit
from their review? Have those reviews occurred? If yes, describe which
reviews took place.

The authors asked the OpenID Foundation FAPI working group to review of this document.
These reviews have happened and the feedback was incorporated into the document.

6. Describe how the document meets any required formal expert review criteria,
such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.

Not applicable


7. If the document contains a YANG module, has the final version of the module
been checked with any of the [recommended validation tools][4] for syntax and
formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is
the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module
comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified
in [<a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC 8342</a>][5]?

There is no YANG module in this document.


8. Describe reviews and automated checks performed to validate sections of the
final version of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code,
BNF rules, MIB definitions, CBOR&#x27;s CDDL, etc.

There is no formal language in this document.

## Document Shepherd Checks

9. Based on the shepherd&#x27;s review of the document, is it their opinion that this
document is needed, clearly written, complete, correctly designed, and ready
to be handed off to the responsible Area Director?

Yes.

10. Several IETF Areas have assembled lists of common issues that their
reviewers encounter[6]. For which areas have such issues been identified
and addressed? For which does this still need to happen in subsequent
reviews?

Beyond OAuth-related security issues no additional common issues on the assembled
lists are applicable.


11. What type of RFC publication is being requested on the IETF stream ([Best
Current Practice][12], [Proposed Standard, Internet Standard][13],
[Informational, Experimental or Historic][14])? Why is this the proper type
of RFC? Do all Datatracker state attributes correctly reflect this intent?

BCP

12. Have reasonable efforts been made to remind all authors of the intellectual
property rights (IPR) disclosure obligations described in [<a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a>][7]? To
the best of your knowledge, have all required disclosures been filed? If
not, explain why. If yes, summarize any relevant discussion, including links
to publicly-available messages when applicable.

13. Has each author, editor, and contributor shown their willingness to be
listed as such? If the total number of authors and editors on the front page
is greater than five, please provide a justification.

14. Document any remaining I-D nits in this document. Simply running the [idnits
tool][8] is not enough; please review the [&quot;Content Guidelines&quot; on
<a href="http://authors.ietf.org">authors.ietf.org</a>][15]. (Also note that the current idnits tool generates
some incorrect warnings; a rewrite is underway.)

There document is OK.

15. Should any informative references be normative or vice-versa? See the [IESG
Statement on Normative and Informative References][16].

The references are declared properly.
Note: There are normative references to static specifications from the OpenID
Foundation, the IEEE and the FIDO Alliance.


16. List any normative references that are not freely available to anyone. Did
the community have sufficient access to review any such normative
references?

All references are freely available. The IEEE specification is available via the
IEEE GET Program. OpenID specifications, W3C and FIDO specifications are available
for download.

17. Are there any normative downward references (see [<a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>][9] and [<a href="/doc/bcp97/">BCP
97</a>][10]) that are not already listed in the [DOWNREF registry][17]? If so,
list them.

There are no downward references but there are normative references to non-IETF documents.

18. Are there normative references to documents that are not ready to be
submitted to the IESG for publication or are otherwise in an unclear state?
If so, what is the plan for their completion?

No.

19. Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? If
so, does the Datatracker metadata correctly reflect this and are those RFCs
listed on the title page, in the abstract, and discussed in the
introduction? If not, explain why and point to the part of the document
where the relationship of this document to these other RFCs is discussed.

No.

20. Describe the document shepherd&#x27;s review of the IANA considerations section,
especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document.
Confirm that all aspects of the document requiring IANA assignments are
associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm
that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm
that each newly created IANA registry specifies its initial contents,
allocations procedures, and a reasonable name (see [<a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>][11]).

There are no IANA considerations

21. List any new IANA registries that require Designated Expert Review for
future allocations. Are the instructions to the Designated Expert clear?
Please include suggestions of designated experts, if appropriate.
