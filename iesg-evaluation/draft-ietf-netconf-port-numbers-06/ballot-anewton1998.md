I have no objection to promotion of this document.

Many thanks to Barry Leiba for his ARTART review, from which I will quote:

    It’s good to clean up these unused port-number assignments, and the document is
    clear about the whats and whys and the fact that they’re confirmed as having
    never been deployed.
