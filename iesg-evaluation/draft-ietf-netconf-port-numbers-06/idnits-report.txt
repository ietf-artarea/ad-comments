71	1.  Introduction

73	   The "Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number" registry
74	   [IANA-SERVICE] records several NETCONF-related port and service name
75	   assignments such as 830 for NETCONF over Secure Shell (SSH)
76	   [RFC6242], 831 for NETCONF over the Blocks Extensible Exchange
77	   Protocol (BEEP) [RFC4744], 832 for NETCONF over the Simple Object
78	   Access Protocol (SOAP) [RFC4743], 4334 for NETCONF Call Home
79	   [RFC8071], and 6513 for NETCONF over Transport Layer Security (TLS)
80	   [RFC7589][I-D.ietf-netconf-over-tls13].

82	   However, three of these assignments are for protocols that are not
83	   deployed and were tagged as Historic ([RFC4743] and [RFC4744]).  All
84	   these assignments are undesirable.

86	   This document de-assigns these unused port numbers.

88	   Consistent with Section 8.2 of [RFC6335], this document does not de-
89	   assign service names; only port numbers are de-assigned for better
90	   usage of available scarce resources.

92	2.  Operational Considerations

94	   There are no known implementations and deployments of protocols that
95	   rely upon the port numbers released back by this document.  As such,
96	   there are no new operations or manageability requirements introduced
97	   by this document.

99	3.  Security Considerations

101	   This document does not describe any protocol.  As such, this document
102	   does not introduce any new security vulnerability.

104	4.  IANA Considerations

106	   This document requests IANA to update the "Service Name and Transport
107	   Protocol Port Number Registry" registry [IANA-SERVICE] as specified
108	   in the following subsections.

110	   Unassigned allocations are marked per Section 8.2 of [RFC6335].
111	   These actions are not repeated here.

113	      Note to the RFC Editor: Please replace "THIS_DOCUMENT" with the
114	      RFC number to be assigned to this document.
