85	1.  Introduction

87	   Matroska is a multimedia container format defined in [RFC9559].  It
88	   can store timestamped multimedia data but also chapters and tags.
89	   The Tag elements add important metadata to identify and classify the
90	   information found in a Matroska Segment.  It can tag a whole Segment,
91	   separate Tracks elements, individual Chapter elements or Attachments
92	   elements.

94	   Some details about tagging are already present in Section 24 of
95	   [RFC9559].  Readers of this document should be familiar with that
96	   section, the different high level parts of Matroska as defined in
97	   Section 4.5 of [RFC9559] and EBML Master Elements as defined in
98	   Section 7.7 of [RFC8794].

100	   While the Matroska tagging framework allows anyone to create their
101	   own custom tags, it is important to have a common set of values for
102	   interoperability.  This document defines a set of common tag names
103	   used in Matroska.

105	2.  Notation and Conventions

107	   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
108	   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
109	   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
110	   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
111	   capitals, as shown here.

113	3.  Tagging

115	   When a SimpleTag is nested within another SimpleTag, the nested
116	   SimpleTag becomes an attribute of its parent SimpleTag.  For
117	   instance, if you wanted to store the dates that a singer started
118	   being the lead performer, then your SimpleTag tree would look
119	   something like this:

121	   *  Targets

123	      -  TagTrackUID = {track UID of tagged content}.

125	   *  ARTIST = "Pet Shop Boys"

127	      -  LEAD_PERFORMER = "Neil Tennant"

129	         o  DATE_STARTED = "1981-08"

131	   This corresponds to this layout of EBML elements:

133	   <Tags>
134	     <Tag>
135	       <Targets>
136	         <TagTrackUID>{track UID of tagged content}</TagTrackUID>
137	       </Targets>

139	       <SimpleTag>
140	         <TagName>ARTIST</TagName>
141	         <TagString>Pet Shop Boys</TagString>

143	         <!-- sub tag(s) about the ARTIST -->
144	         <SimpleTag>
145	           <TagName>LEAD_PERFORMER</TagName>
146	           <TagString>Neil Tennant</TagString>

148	           <!-- sub tag(s) about the LEAD_PERFORMER -->
149	           <SimpleTag>
150	             <TagName>DATE_STARTED</TagName>
151	             <TagString>1981-08</TagString>
152	           </SimpleTag>

154	         </SimpleTag>

156	       </SimpleTag>
157	     </Tag>
158	   </Tags>

160	   In this way, it becomes possible to store any SimpleTag as attributes
161	   of another SimpleTag.

163	3.1.  Why Official Tags Matter

165	   There is a debate between people who think all tags should be free
166	   and those who think all tags should be strict.  Our recommendations
167	   are in between.

169	   Advanced-users application might let you put any tag in your file.
170	   But for the rest of the applications, they usually give you a basic
171	   list of tags you can use.  Both have their needs, but it's usually a
172	   bad idea to use custom or exotic tags because you will probably be
173	   the only person to use this information even though everyone else
174	   could benefit from it.  So hopefully, when someone wants to put
175	   information in one's file, they will find an official one that fits
176	   their need and hopefully use it.  If it's not in the list, this
177	   person can try to add a new tag in the Matroska Tags Names registry
178	   (Section 6.1).  This registry is not meant to have every possible
179	   information in a file.  Matroska files are not meant to become a
180	   whole database of people who made costumes for a film.  A website
181	   would be better for that.  It's hard to define what should be in and
182	   what ought not be in a file because it doesn't make sense; thus, each
183	   request needs to be evaluated to determine if it makes sense to be
184	   carried over in a file for storage and/or sharing or if it doesn't
185	   belong there.

187	   We also need an official list simply for developers to be able to
188	   display relevant information in their own design, if they choose to
189	   support a list of meta-information they should know which tag has the
190	   wanted meaning so that other apps could understand the same meaning.

192	3.2.  Tag Formatting

194	3.2.1.  TagName Formatting

196	   Official TagName values MUST consist of UTF-8 capital letters,
197	   numbers and the underscore character '_'.

199	   Official TagName values MUST NOT contain any space.

201	   Official TagName values MUST NOT start with the underscore character
202	   '_'; see Section 3.1.

204	   It is RECOMMENDED that tag names start with the underscore character
205	   '_' for non official tags that are not meant to be added to the list
206	   of official tags.

208	3.2.2.  TagString Formatting

210	   Although tags are metadata mostly used for reading, there are cases
211	   where the string value could be used for sorting, categorization,
212	   etc.  For this reason, when possible, strict formatting of the value
213	   should be used so everyone can agree on how to use the value.

215	   Multiple items SHOULD NOT be stored as a list in a single TagString.
216	   If there is more than one tag value with the same name to be stored,
217	   it is RECOMMENDED to use separate SimpleTags with that name for each
218	   value.

220	   Preexisting files may have used multiple values in the same TagString
221	   but given there is no defined delimiters they cannot be easily split
222	   into multiple elements.  INSTRUMENTS (Section 4.4) and KEYWORDS
223	   (Section 4.6) tags allow using a comma as a separator.  However, it
224	   is RECOMMENDED to use separate SimpleTags with each containing a
225	   single instrument or keyword value, respectively.

227	   Due to the varied nature of tag sources it may also not always
228	   possible to know programmatically whether a value is a list that must
229	   be split or not.

231	3.2.2.1.  Date Tags Formatting

233	   TagString fields defined in this document with dates MUST have the
234	   following format: "YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss.mss" or a reduced version.
235	   The format is similar to the [ISO8601] date and time format defined
236	   in Appendix A of [RFC3339] without the "T" separator, without the
237	   time offset and with the addition of the milliseconds "mss".  The
238	   date and times represented are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

240	   Date and times are usually not precise to a particular millisecond.
241	   To store less accurate dates, parts of the date string are removed
242	   starting from the right.  For instance, to store only the year, one
243	   would use "2004".  To store a specific day such as May 1st, 2003, one
244	   would use "2003-05-01".

246	   The syntax of this tags-date-time is defined using this Augmented
247	   Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234]:

249	      time-hour         = 2DIGIT ; 00-24
250	      time-minute       = 2DIGIT ; 00-59
251	      time-second       = 2DIGIT ; 00-58, 00-59, 00-60 based on
252	                                 ; leap-second rules
253	      time-millisecond  = 3DIGIT ; 000-999

255	      timespec-hour     = time-hour
256	      timespec-minute   = timespec-hour ":" time-minute
257	      timespec-second   = timespec-minute ":" time-second
258	      timespec-milli    = timespec-second "." time-millisecond

260	      time              = timespec-hour / timespec-minute
261	                          / timespec-second / timespec-milli

263	      date-fullyear   = 4DIGIT  ; 0000-9999
264	      date-month      = 2DIGIT  ; 01-12
265	      date-mday       = 2DIGIT  ; 01-28, 01-29, 01-30, 01-31 based on
266	                                ; month/year

268	      datespec-year     = date-fullyear
269	      datespec-month    = datespec-year "-" date-month
270	      datespec-full     = datespec-month "-" date-mday
271	      datespec-time     = datespec-full " " time

273	      tags-date-time    = datespec-time / datespec-full
274	                          / datespec-month / datespec-year

276	3.2.2.2.  Number Tags Formatting

278	   TagString fields that require a floating-point number MUST use the
279	   "." mark instead of the "," mark.  Only ASCII numbers "0" to "9" and
280	   the "." character MUST be used.  The "." separator represents the
281	   boundary between the integer value and the decimal parts.  If the
282	   string doesn't contain the "." separator, the value is an integer
283	   value.  Digit grouping delimiters MUST NOT be used.

285	   To display it differently for another locale, it is RECOMMENDED that
286	   applications support auto replacement on display.  The thousand
287	   separator MAY be inserted for display purposes.  The decimal
288	   separator "."  MAY be replaced to match the user locale for display
289	   purposes.

291	   In legacy media containers, it is possible that the "," character
292	   might have been used as a separator or that digit grouping delimiters
293	   might have been used.  A Matroska Reader SHOULD consider the
294	   following character handling to parse such legacy formats:

296	   *  if multiple instances of the same non-number character are found,
297	      they are be ignored,
298	   *  if only one "." character is found and no other non-number
299	      character is found, the "." is the integer-decimal separator,
300	   *  if only one "," character is found and no other non-number
301	      character is found, the "," is a digit grouping delimiter,
302	   *  any other non-number character is ignored.

304	3.2.2.3.  Country Code Tags Formatting

306	   TagString fields that use a Country Code MUST use the Matroska
307	   countries form defined in Section 13 of [RFC9559], i.e. [RFC5646]
308	   two-letter region subtags, without the UK exception.

310	3.3.  Target Types

312	   The TargetTypeValue element allows tagging of different parts that
313	   are within or outside a given file.  For example, in an audio file
314	   with one song you could have information about the CD set album it
315	   comes from, even if the whole CD set is not found in the file.

317	   For applications to know the kind of information (e.g., "TITLE")
318	   relates to a certain level (CD title or track title), we also need a
319	   set of official TargetTypeValue values and TargetType names.  That
320	   also means the same tag name can have different meanings depending on
321	   its TargetTypeValue, otherwise we would end up with 7 "TITLE_" tag
322	   names.

324	   For human readability a TargetType string can be added next to the
325	   corresponding TargetTypeValue.  Audio and video have different
326	   TargetType values.  The following table summarizes the TargetType
327	   values found in Section 5.1.8.1.1.2 of [RFC9559] for audio and video
328	   content:

388	         Table 2: TargetTypeValue Values Video Semantic Description

390	   A tag defined for a given TargetTypeValue also applies to all Targets
391	   with numerically smaller TargetTypeValues in the same hierarchy, that
392	   is, from higher-level groups to lower-level entities.  This means
393	   that if a CD has the same artist for all tracks, you just need to set
394	   the "ARTIST" tag at TargetTypeValue 50 (ALBUM) and not to each
395	   TargetTypeValue 30 (TRACK), but you can also repeat the value for
396	   each track.  If some tracks of that CD have no known "ARTIST", the
397	   value MUST be set to an empty string ("") as detailed in Section 24.2
398	   of [RFC9559], so that the album "ARTIST" doesn't apply.

400	   If a tag with a given TagName is found at a TargetTypeValue, only
401	   values of that TagName are valid at that TargetTypeValue level.  In
402	   other words, the TagName values from upper TargetTypeValue levels
403	   don't apply at that level.

405	   Multiple SimpleTag with the same TagName can be used at a given
406	   TargetTypeValue level when each SimpleTag contain a TagString.  For
407	   example this can be useful to find a single "ARTIST" even when they
408	   are found in a collaboration.  The concatenation of each TagString
409	   represents the value for the TagName at this level.  The
410	   presentation, for instance with a separator, is up to the
411	   application.

413	3.3.1.  Target Types Parts

415	   There are three organizational tags defined in Section 4.2:

417	   *  TOTAL_PARTS

419	   *  PART_NUMBER

421	   *  PART_OFFSET

423	   These tags allow specifying the ordering of some tags within another
424	   group of tags.

426	   For example if you have an album with 10 tracks and you want to tag
427	   the second track from it.  You set "TOTAL_PARTS" to "10" at
428	   TargetTypeValue 50 (ALBUM).  It means the "ALBUM" contains 10 lower
429	   parts.  The lower part in question is the first lower TargetTypeValue
430	   that is specified in the file.  So, if it's TargetTypeValue = 30
431	   (TRACK), then that means the album contains 10 tracks.  If
432	   TargetTypeValue is 20 (MOVEMENT), that means the album contains 10
433	   movements, etc.  And since it's the second track within the album,
434	   the "PART_NUMBER" at TargetTypeValue 30 (TRACK) is set to "2".

436	   If the parts are split into multiple logical entities, you can also
437	   use "PART_OFFSET".  For example you are tagging the third track of
438	   the second CD of a double CD album with a total of 10 tracks the
439	   "TOTAL_PARTS" at TargetTypeValue 50 (ALBUM) is "10", the
440	   "PART_NUMBER" at TargetTypeValue 30 (TRACK) is "3", and the the
441	   "PART_OFFSET" at TargetTypeValue 30 (TRACK) is "5", which is the
442	   number of tracks on the first CD.

444	   When a TargetTypeValue level doesn't exist it MUST NOT be specified
445	   in the files, so that the "TOTAL_PARTS" and "PART_NUMBER" elements
446	   match the same levels.

448	   Here is an example of an audio record with 2 tracks in a single file,
449	   corresponding to [DaFunk].  There is one Tag element for the record,
450	   and one Tag element per track on the record.  Each track is
451	   identified by a chapter.

453	   The Tag for the record:

455	   *  Targets
456	      -  TargetTypeValue = 50

458	   *  ARTIST = "Daft Punk"

460	   *  TITLE = "Da Funk"

462	   *  TOTAL_PARTS = "2"

464	   The Tag for the first track:

466	   *  Targets

468	      -  TargetTypeValue = 30

470	      -  TagChapterUID = 12345

472	   *  TITLE = "Da Funk"

474	   *  PART_NUMBER = "1"

476	   The Tag for the second track:

478	   *  Targets

480	      -  TargetTypeValue = 30

482	      -  TagChapterUID = 67890

484	   *  TITLE = "Rollin' & Scratchin'"

486	   *  PART_NUMBER = "2"

488	   This corresponds to this layout of EBML elements:

549	   Here is an example using the "PART_OFFSET" tag.  It corresponds to a
550	   file that contains the third track on the second CD of the 2-CD album
551	   "The Orb's Adventures Beyond The Ultraworld" [OrbUltraworld]:

553	   The Tag for the album:

555	   *  Targets

557	      -  TargetTypeValue = 50

559	   *  ARTIST = "Orb"

634	3.4.  Multiple Targets UID

636	   A Tag element has a single Targets element with a single
637	   TargetTypeValue element.  However, the Targets element can contain
638	   various TagTrackUID, TagEditionUID, TagChapterUID and
639	   TagAttachmentUID elements.

641	   When multiple values are found using the same Tag UID element (e.g.,
642	   TagTrackUID) a logical OR is applied on these elements.  In other
643	   words the tags apply to each entity defined by a UID.  This is the
644	   list of UIDs the tags apply to (e.g., list of TagTrackUID).  Such a
645	   list may contain a single UID element.

647	   When different lists of Tag UID elements are found (e.g., a list of
648	   TagTrackUID and a list of TagChapterUID) a logical AND is applied
649	   between those lists.  In other words the tags apply only to the
650	   entities matching a UID in each list of Tag UID elements.

652	   These operations allow factorizing tags that would otherwise need to
653	   be repeated multiple times.

655	   Here is an example of a Tag applying to 2 chapters, using the same
656	   [DaFunk] example as in Section 3.3.1:

658	   *  Targets

660	      -  TargetTypeValue = 30

662	      -  TagChapterUID = 12345

664	      -  TagChapterUID = 67890

666	   *  WRITTEN_BY = "Thomas Bangalter"

668	   *  WRITTEN_BY = "Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo"

670	   *  PRODUCER = "Thomas Bangalter"

672	   *  PRODUCER = "Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo"

674	   This corresponds to this layout of EBML elements:

676	   <Tags>
677	     <Tag>
678	       <Targets>
679	         <TargetTypeValue>30</TargetTypeValue>

681	         <!-- chapter with Da Funk -->
682	         <TagChapterUID>12345</TagChapterUID>

684	         <!-- chapter with Rollin' & Scratchin' -->
685	         <TagChapterUID>67890</TagChapterUID>
686	       </Targets>

688	       <!-- first writer of Da Funk and Rollin' & Scratchin' -->
689	       <SimpleTag>
690	         <TagName>WRITTEN_BY</TagName>
691	         <TagString>Thomas Bangalter</TagString>
692	       </SimpleTag>

694	       <!-- second writer of Da Funk and Rollin' & Scratchin' -->
695	       <SimpleTag>
696	         <TagName>WRITTEN_BY</TagName>
697	         <TagString>Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo</TagString>
698	       </SimpleTag>

700	       <!-- first producer of Da Funk and Rollin' & Scratchin' -->
701	       <SimpleTag>
702	         <TagName>PRODUCER</TagName>
703	         <TagString>Thomas Bangalter</TagString>
704	       </SimpleTag>

706	       <!-- second producer of Da Funk and Rollin' & Scratchin' -->
707	       <SimpleTag>
708	         <TagName>PRODUCER</TagName>
709	         <TagString>Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo</TagString>
710	       </SimpleTag>
711	     </Tag>
712	   </Tags>

714	   Some combinations of different Tag UID elements are not possible.

716	   A TagChapterUID and TagAttachmentUID can't be mixed because there is
717	   no overlap with a Chapter and an Attachment that would make sense.
718	   An attachment applies to the whole segment and can be tied to tracks,
719	   via \Segment\Tracks\TrackEntry\AttachmentLink as defined in
720	   Section 5.1.4.1.24 of [RFC9559], but not chapters.

722	   Mixing TagEditionUID and TagChapterUID elements is also not useful
723	   because each Chapter UID would need to be in one of the Chapter
724	   Edition UID.  That would be the same as not using the list of
725	   TagEditionUID at all.

727	   The following table shows the allowed combinations between lists of
728	   Tag UID elements:

730	   +============+================+=========+=========+================+
731	   | UID        | Track          | Edition | Chapter | Attachment     |
732	   | elements   |                |         |         |                |
733	   +============+================+=========+=========+================+

735	   |            |                |         |         | AttachmentLink |
736	   +------------+----------------+---------+---------+----------------+

739	   | Chapter    | YES            | NO      | YES     | NO             |

743	   +------------+----------------+---------+---------+----------------+

745	              Table 3: Tag UID elements allowed combinations

747	   Here is an example of a Tag applying to a single track and a single
748	   chapter.  It represents the composer of the music in a part of a
749	   movie.  The file may contain a second audio track with audio
750	   commentary not including that music, so we only tag the track with
751	   the music.

753	   *  Targets

755	      -  TargetTypeValue = 30

757	      -  TagTrackUID = 123

759	      -  TagChapterUID = 987654321

761	   *  COMPOSER = "Hans Zimmer"

763	   This corresponds to this layout of EBML elements:

765	   <Tags>
766	     <Tag>
767	       <Targets>
768	         <TargetTypeValue>30</TargetTypeValue>

786	4.  Official Tags

788	   The following is a complete list of the supported Matroska Tags.  As
789	   stated in Section 3.1 it is better to use official tags as much as
790	   possible, otherwise compatibility will be compromised.  If you find
791	   that there is a Tag missing that you would like to use, then please
792	   contact the persons mentioned in the IANA Matroska Tags Registry for
793	   its inclusion; see Section 6.1.

795	4.1.  Nesting Information

797	   Nesting Information tags are tags that usually contain any other
798	   tags.

1663	5.  Security Considerations

1665	   This document inherits security considerations from the EBML
1666	   [RFC8794] and Matroska [RFC9559] documents.

1668	   Tag values can be either TagString or TagBinary blobs.  In both cases
1669	   issues can happen if the parsing of the data fails.

1671	   Most of the time strings are kept as-is and don't pose a security
1672	   issue, apart from invalid UTF-8 values.  Implementations MUST
1673	   validate TagString inputs for UTF-8 correctness and reasonable length
1674	   before use, in accordance with the security considerations in
1675	   Section 10 of [RFC3629].

1677	   String tags that are parsed like "REPLAYGAIN_GAIN" or
1678	   "REPLAYGAIN_PEAK" defined in Section 4.10 or string tags following
1679	   the rules from Section 3.2.2 or string tags following other strict
1680	   formats like URLs may cause issues when the string is bogus or in an
1681	   unexpected format.

1683	   Binary tags that need to be parsed like "MCDI" defined in
1684	   Section 4.11 may cause issues when the data is bogus or incomplete.

1686	   Some tags like "URL" (Section 4.4) and "PURCHASE_URL" (Section 4.12)
1687	   contain a URL.  Bogus or altered URLs may direct the user to unwanted
1688	   places.

1690	   Due to the nature of nested SimpleTag, it is possible to exhaust the
1691	   memory of the host app by using very deep nesting.  A host app MAY
1692	   add some limits to the amount of nesting possible to avoid such
1693	   issues.

1695	   Some elements found in Section 4.4 and Section 4.9 may contain
1696	   physical addresses, email, etc. about a person.  Care should be taken
1697	   to ensure not to provide such files to people that ought not have
1698	   this information when it's not public knowledge.  This can be
1699	   achieved by either removing personal information or by controlling
1700	   the diffusion of files containing these information.

1702	6.  IANA Considerations

1704	6.1.  Matroska Tags Names Registry

1706	   IANA has created a new registry called the "Matroska Tag Names"
1707	   registry.

1709	   To register a new Tag Name in this registry, one needs a Name, a
1710	   Type, a Change Controller, and an optional Reference to a document
1711	   describing the Element ID.

1713	   The Name corresponds to the value stored in the TagName element.  The
1714	   Name SHOULD always be written in all capital letters and contain no
1715	   space as defined in Section 3.2,

1717	   The Type corresponds to which element will be stored the tag value.
1718	   There can be 3 values for the Type:

1720	   *  UTF-8: the value of the Tag is stored in TagString,

1722	   Matroska Tag Names for UTF-8 data are to be allocated according to
1723	   the "First Come First Served" policy [RFC8126].

1725	   *  binary: the value of the Tag is stored in TagBinary,

1727	   Matroska Tag Names for binary data are to be allocated according to
1728	   the "Specification Required" policy [RFC8126].

1730	   *  nested: the tag doesn't contain a value, only nested tags inside.

1732	   Matroska Tag Names for nested tags are to be allocated according to
1733	   the "Specification Required" policy [RFC8126].

1735	   Matroska Tag Names Values found in this document are assigned as
1736	   initial values as follows:
