75	1.  Introduction

77	   Successful operation of large or busy networks depends on effective
78	   network management.  This requires a virtuous circle of network
79	   control, network observability, network analytics, network assurance,
80	   and back to network control.  Network fault and problem management
81	   [RFC6632] is an important aspect of network management and control
82	   solutions.  It deals with the detection, reporting, inspection,
83	   isolation, correlation, and management of events within the network.
84	   The intention of this document is to focus on those events that have
85	   a negative effect on the network's ability to forward traffic
86	   according to expected behavior and so deliver services.  Fault and
87	   problem management extends to include actions taken to determine the
88	   causes of problems and to work toward recovery of expected network
89	   behavior.

91	   A number of work efforts within the IETF seek to provide components
92	   of a fault management system, such as YANG models or management
93	   protocols.  It is important that a common terminology is used so that
94	   there is a clear understanding of how the elements of the management
95	   and control solutions fit together, and how faults and problems will
96	   be handled.

98	   This document sets out some terms that are fundamental to a common
99	   understanding of network fault and problem management.  While
100	   "faults" and "problems" are concepts that apply at all levels of
101	   technology in the Internet, the scope of this document is restricted
102	   to the network layer and below, hence this document is specifically
103	   about "network fault and problem management."  The concept of
104	   "incidents" is also touched on in this document, where an incident
105	   results from one or more problems and is the disruption of a network
106	   service.

108	   Note that some useful terms are defined in [RFC3877] and [RFC8632].
109	   The definitions in this document are informed by those documents, but
110	   they are not dependent on that prior work.

112	2.  Usage of Terms

114	   The terms defined in this document are principally intended for
115	   consistent use within the IETF.  Where similar concepts are described
116	   in other bodies, an attempt has been made to harmonize with those
117	   other descriptions, but there is care needed where terms are not used
118	   consistently between bodies or where terms are applied outside the
119	   network layer.  If other bodies find the terminology defined in this
120	   document useful, they are free to use it.

122	   The purpose of this document is to define the following terms for use
123	   in other documents.  Other terms are defined to enable those
124	   definitions and may also be used by other documents, although that is
125	   not the principal purpose of their definitions here.

127	   *  Event
128	   *  State
129	   *  Fault
130	   *  Problem
131	   *  Symptom
132	   *  Cause
133	   *  Alert
134	   *  Alarm

136	   When other documents make use of the terms as defined in this
137	   document, it is suggested here that such uses should use
138	   capitalization of the terms as in this document to help distinguish
139	   them from colloquial uses, and should include an early section
140	   listing the terms inherited from this document with a citation.

142	3.  Terminology

144	   This section contains key terms.  It is split into three subsections.

146	   *  Section 3.1 contains terms that help to set the context for
147	      network fault and problem management systems.

149	   *  Section 3.2 includes specific and detailed core terms that will be
150	      used in other documents that describe elements of the network
151	      fault and problem management systems.

153	   *  Section 3.3 provides three further terms that may be helpful.

155	3.1.  Context Terminology

157	   This section includes some terminology that helps describe the
158	   context for the rest of this work.  The terms may be viewed as a
159	   cascaded sequence of processes, starting with Network Telemetry and
160	   building to Network Observability.  The definitions are deliberately
161	   kept relatively terse.  Further documents may expand on these terms
162	   without loss of specificity.  Such contextualization (if any) should
163	   be highlighted clearly in those documents.

165	   Network Telemetry:  This is defined in [RFC9232] and describes the
166	      process of collecting operational network data categorized
167	      according to the network plane (e.g., layer 3, layer 2, layer 1)
168	      from which it was derived.  Data collected through the Network
169	      Telemetry process does not contain any data related to service
170	      definitions (i.e., "intent" per Section 3.1 of [RFC9315]).

172	   Network Monitoring:  This is the process of keeping a continuous
173	      record of functions related to a network topology.  It involves
174	      tracking various aspects such as traffic patterns, device health,
175	      performance metrics, and overall network behaviour.  This approach
176	      differentiates network monitoring from resource or device
177	      monitoring, which focuses on individual components or resources
178	      (Section 3.2).

180	   Network Analytics:  Network Analytics is the process of deriving
181	      analytical insights from operational network data.  A process
182	      could be a piece of software, a system, or a human that analyzes
183	      operational data and outputs new analytical data related to the
184	      operational data, for example, a symptom.

186	   Network Observability:  The Network Observability process is the
187	      enablement of network behavioral assessment through analysis of
188	      observed operational network data (logs, alarms, traces, etc.)
189	      with the aim of detecting symptoms of network behavior, and to
190	      identify anomalies and their causes.  Network Observability begins
191	      with information gathered using Network Monitoring tools and that
192	      may be further enriched with other operational data.  The expected
193	      outcome of the observability processes is identification and
194	      analysis of deviations in observed state versus the expected state
195	      of a network.

197	   Thus, there is a cascaded sequence where the following relationships
198	   apply.

200	   *  Network Telemetry is the process of collecting operational data
201	      from a network.

203	   *  Network Monitoring is the process of creating/keeping a record of
204	      data gathered in Network Telemetry.

206	   *  Network Analytics is the process of deriving insight through the
207	      data recorded in Network Monitoring.

209	   *  Network Observability is the process of enabling behavioral
210	      assessment of a network through Network Analytics.

212	3.2.  Core Terms

214	   The terms are presented below in an order that is intended to flow
215	   such that it is possible to gain understanding reading top to bottom.
216	   The figures and explanations in Section 4 may aid understanding the
217	   terms set out here.

219	   Resource:  An element of a network system.

221	      Resource is a recursive concept so that a Resource may be a
222	      collection of other Resources (for example, a network node
223	      comprises a collection of network interfaces).

225	   Characteristic:  Observable or measurable aspect or behavior
226	      associated with a Resource.

228	      *  A Characteristic may be considered to be built on facts (see
229	         'Value', below) and the contexts and descriptors that identify
230	         and give meaning to the facts.

232	      *  The term "Metric" [RFC9417] is another word for a measurable
233	         Characteristic which may also be thought of as analogous to a
234	         'variable'.

236	   Value:  A Value is a measure of a Characteristic associated with a
237	      Resource.  It may be in the form of a categorization (e.g., high
238	      or low), an integer (e.g., a count or gauge), or a reading of a
239	      continuous variable (e.g., an analog measurement), etc.

241	   Change:  In the context of Network Monitoring, a Change is the
242	      variation in the Value of a Characteristic associated with a
243	      Resource and may arise over a period of time.

245	      *  Not all Changes are noteworthy (i.e., they do not have
246	         Relevance).

248	      *  Perception of Change depends upon Detection, the sampling
249	         rate/accuracy/detail, and perspective.

251	      *  It may be helpful to qualify this as "Value Change" because the
252	         English word "change" is often heavily used.

254	   Event:  The variation in Value of a Characteristic of a Resource at a
255	      distinct moment in time (i.e., the period is negligible).

257	      *  Compared with a Change, which may be over a period of time, an
258	         Event happens at a distinct moment in time.  Thus, an Event may
259	         be the observation of a Change.

261	   Condition:  A Condition is an interpretation of the Values of a set
262	      of one or more Characteristics of a Resource (with respect to
263	      working order or some other aspect relevant to the Resource
264	      purpose/application), for example "low available memory".  Thus,
265	      it is the output of a function applied to a set of one or more
266	      variables.

268	   State:  A particular Condition that a Resource has (i.e., it is in a
269	      State) at a specific time.  For example, a router may report the
270	      total amount of memory it has, and how much is free.  These are
271	      the Values of two Characteristics of a Resource.  These Values can
272	      be interpreted to determine the Condition of the Resource, and
273	      that may determine the State of the router, such as shortage of
274	      memory.

276	      *  While a State may be observed at a specific moment in time, it
277	         is actually determined by summarizing measurement over time in
278	         a process sometimes called State compression.

280	      *  It may be helpful to qualify this as "Resource State" to make
281	         clear the distinction between this and other uses of "state"
282	         such as "protocol state".

284	      *  This term may be contrasted with "Operational State" as used in
285	         [RFC8342].  For example, the state of a link might be up/down/
286	         degraded, but the operational state of link would include a
287	         collection of Values of Characteristics of the link.

289	   Detect (hence Detected, Detection):  To notice the presence of
290	      something (State, Change, Event, activity, etc.).

292	      *  Hence also to notice a Change (from the perspective of an
293	         observer such as a monitoring system).

295	   Relevance:  Consideration of an Event, State, or Value (through the
296	      application of policy, relative to a specific perspective, intent,
297	      and in relation to other Events, States, and Values) to determine
298	      whether it is of note to the system that controls or manages the
299	      network.  Note, for example, that not all Changes are Relevant.

301	      *  This term may also be used as "Relevant Event", "Relevant
302	         State", or "Relevant Value".

304	   Occurrence:  A Relevant Event or a particular Relevant Change.

306	      *  An Occurrence may be an aggregation or abstraction of multiple
307	         fine-grain Events or Changes.

309	      *  An Occurrence may occur at any macro or micro scale because
310	         Resources are a recursive concept, and may be perceived
311	         depending on the scope of observation (i.e., according to the
312	         level of Resource recursion that is examined).  That is,
313	         Occurrences, themselves a recursive concept.

315	   Fault:  An Occurrence (i.e., an Event or a Change) that is not
316	      desired/required (as it may be indicative of a current or future
317	      undesired State).  Thus, a Fault happens at a moment in time.  A
318	      Fault can potentially be associated with a Cause.  See [RFC8632]
319	      for a more detailed discussion of network faults.

321	      *  Note that there is a distinction between a Fault and a Problem
322	         that depends on context.  For example, in a connectivity
323	         service where redundancy is present, a link down is a Problem,
324	         but from the perspective of managing the network resources, a
325	         link down is a Fault.  Likewise, for example, in a router with
326	         two power supplies, if the backup power supply fails, this is a
327	         Problem.

329	   Problem:  A State that is undesirable and that may require remedial
330	      action.  A Problem cannot necessarily be associated with a Cause.
331	      The resolution of a Problem does not necessarily act on the thing
332	      that has the Problem.

334	      *  Note that there is a historic aspect to the concept of a
335	         Problem.  The current State may be operational, but there could
336	         have been a Fault that is unexplained, and the fact of that
337	         unexplained recent Fault is a Problem.

339	      *  Note that while a Problem is unresolved it may continue to
340	         require attention.  A record of resolved Problems may be
341	         maintained in a log.

343	      *  Note that there may be a State which is considered to be a
344	         Problem from several perspectives.  For example, consider a
345	         "loss of light" State that may cause multiple services to fail.
346	         In this example, a new State (the light recovers) may cause the
347	         Problem to be resolved from one perspective (the services are
348	         operational once more), but may leave the Problem as unresolved
349	         (because the loss of light has not been explained).  Further,
350	         in this example, there could be another development (the reason
351	         for the temporary loss of light is traced to a microbend in the
352	         fiber that is repaired) resulting in that unresolved Problem
353	         now being resolved.  But, in this example, this still leaves a
354	         further Problem unresolved (a microbend occurred, and that
355	         Problem is not resolved until it is understood how it occurred
356	         and a remedy is put in place to prevent recurrence).

358	   Cause:  The Events (Detected or otherwise) that gave rise to a Fault/
359	      Problem.

361	   Incident:  A (Network) Incident is an undesired Occurrence such as an
362	      unexpected interruption of a network service, degradation of the
363	      quality of a network service, or the below-target performance of a
364	      network service.  An Incident results from one or more Problems,
365	      and a Problem may give rise to or contribute to one or more
366	      Incidents.  Greater discussion of Network Incident relationships,
367	      including Customer Incidents and Incident management, can be found
368	      in [I-D.ietf-nmop-network-incident-yang].

370	   Symptom:  An observable Value, Change, State, Event, or Condition
371	      considered as an indication of a Problem or potential Problem.

373	   Anomaly:  A (Network) Anomaly is an unusual or unexpected Event or
374	      pattern in network data in the forwarding plane, control plane, or
375	      management plane that deviates from the normal, expected behavior.
376	      See [I-D.ietf-nmop-network-anomaly-architecture] for more details.

378	   Alert:  An indication of a Fault.

380	   Alarm:  As specified in [RFC8632], an Alarm signifies an undesirable
381	      State in a Resource that requires corrective action.  From a
382	      management point of view, an Alarm can be seen as a State in its
383	      own right and the transition to this State may result in an Alert
384	      being issued.  The receipt of this Alert may give rise to a
385	      continuous indication (to a human operator) highlighting the
386	      potential or actual presence of a Problem.

388	3.3.  Other Terms

390	   Three other terms may be helpful:

392	   Intermittent:  A State that is not continuous, but keeps occurring in
393	      some time frame.

395	   Transient:  A State that is not continuous, and occurs once in some
396	      time frame.

398	   Recurrent:  A Problem that is actively resolved, but reoccurs.

400	4.  Workflow Explanations

402	   This section aims to add information about the relationship between
403	   the terms defined in Section 3.2.  The text and figures here are for
404	   explanation and are not normative for the definition of terms.

406	   The relationship between Resources and Characteristics is shown in
407	   Figure 1.  Note that there is a 1:n relationship between Network
408	   system and Resources, and between Resources and Characteristics: this
409	   is not shown on the figure for clarity.

421	   The Value of a Characteristic of a Resource may change over time.
422	   Specific Changes in Value may be noticed at a specific time (as
423	   digital Changes), Detected, and treated as Events.  This is shown on
424	   the left of Figure 2.

426	   The center of Figure 2 shows how the Value of a Characteristic may
427	   change over time.  The Value may be Detected at specific times or
428	   periodically and give rise to States (and consequently State
429	   Changes).

431	   In practice, the Characteristic may vary in an analog manner over
432	   time as shown on the right-hand side of Figure 2.  The Value can be
433	   read or reported (i.e., Detected) periodically leading to analog
434	   Values that may be deemed Relevant Values, or may be evaluated over
435	   time as shown in Figure 6.

452	                   Figure 2: Characteristics and Changes

454	   Figure 3 shows the workflow progress for Events.  As noted above, an
455	   Event is a Change in the Value of a Characteristic at a time.  The
456	   Event may be evaluated (considering policy, relative to a specific
457	   perspective, with a view to intent, and in relation to other Events,
458	   States, and Values) to determine if it is an Occurrence and possibly
459	   to indicate a Change of State.  An Occurrence may be undesirable (a
460	   Fault) and that can cause an Alert to be generated, may be evidence
461	   of a Problem and could directly indicate a Cause.  In some cases, an
462	   Alert may give rise to an Alarm highlighting the potential or actual
463	   presence of a Problem.

486	                    Figure 3: Event and Dependent Terms

488	   Parallel to the workflow for Events, Figure 4 shows the workflow
489	   progress for States.  As shown in Figure 2, Change noted at a
490	   particular time gives rise to State.  The State may be deemed to have
491	   Relevance considering policy, relative to a specific perspective,
492	   with a view to intent, and in relation to other Events, States, and
493	   Values.  A Relevant State may be deemed a Problem, or may indicate a
494	   Problem or potential Problem.

496	   Problems may be considered based on Symptoms and may map directly or
497	   indirectly to Causes.  An Incident results from one or more Problems.
498	   An Alarm may be raised as the result of a Problem, and the transition
499	   to an Alarmed state may give rise to an Alert.

515	                    Figure 4: State and Dependent Terms

517	   Figure 5 shows how Faults and Problems may be consolidated to
518	   determine the Causes.  The arrows show how one item may give rise to
519	   another.

521	   A Cause can be indicated by or determined from Faults, Problems, and
522	   Symptoms.  It may be that one Cause points to another, and can also
523	   be considered as a Symptom.  The determination of Causes can consider
524	   multiple inputs.  An Incident results from one or more Problems.

543	               Figure 5: Consolidation of Symptoms and Causes

545	   Figure 6 shows how thresholds are important in the consideration of
546	   analog Values and Events.  The arrows in the figure show how one item
547	   may give rise to or utilize another.  The use of threshold-driven
548	   Events and States (and the Alerts that they might give rise to) must
549	   be treated with caution to dampen any "flapping" (so that consistent
550	   States may be observed) and to avoid overwhelming management
551	   processes or systems.  Analog Values may be read or notified from the
552	   Resource and could transition a threshold, be deemed Relevant Values,
553	   or evaluated over time.  Events may be counted, and the Count may
554	   cross a threshold or reach a Relevant Value.

556	   The Threshold Process may be implementation-specific and subject to
557	   policies.  When a threshold is crossed and any other conditions are
558	   matched, an Event may be determined, and treated like any other
559	   Event.

589	5.  Security Considerations

591	   This document specifies terminology and has no direct effect on the
592	   security of implementations or deployments.  However, protocol
593	   solutions and management models need to be aware of several aspects:

595	   *  The exposure of information pertaining to Faults and Problems may
596	      make available knowledge of the internal workings of a network (in
597	      particular its vulnerabilities) that may be of use to an attacker.

599	   *  Systems that generate management information (messages,
600	      notifications, etc.) when Faults occur, may be attacked by causing
601	      them to generate so much information that the system that manages
602	      the network is swamped and unable to properly manage the network.

604	   *  Reporting false information about Faults (or masking reports of
605	      Faults) may cause the system that manages the network to function
606	      incorrectly.

608	6.  Privacy Considerations

610	   In general, network fault and problem management should not expose
611	   information about end-user activities or user data.  The main privacy
612	   concern is for a network operator to keep control of all information
613	   about Faults to protect their privacy and the details of how the
614	   network operators operate their network.

616	7.  IANA Considerations

618	   This document makes no requests for IANA action.
