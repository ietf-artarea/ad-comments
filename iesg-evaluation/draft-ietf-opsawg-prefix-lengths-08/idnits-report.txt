79	1.  Introduction

81	   Internet service providers (ISPs) delegate IP addresses or entire IP
82	   prefixes to their users.  Similarly, cloud providers assign customers
83	   who use their services such as virtual machines a prefix of a
84	   specific size.  Therefore, there are a multitude of variations of
85	   different end-site prefix length present in the Internet.  Currently,
86	   there is no easy way for content providers to know the end-site
87	   prefix size of someone accessing their service.  Knowing the correct
88	   end-site's prefix size has multiple implications such as:

90	   *  Blocklisting/throttling: In IPv4, IP addresses can be blocked
91	      using variable prefix lengths for different prefixes, such as /22
92	      for prefix A, /27 for prefix B, or /32 to block a single IPv4
93	      address.  In IPv6 on the other hand, blocking at e.g. the /48 or
94	      /56 level could lead to overblocking (throwing multiple VMs from
95	      different users into the same bucket), while blocking at more
96	      fine-granular levels e.g. /64, /96, or even /128 to block a single
97	      IPv6 address would lead to filling up space in the blocklist
98	      pretty quickly.  The use of temporary addresses in IPv6 [RFC8981]
99	      might lead to unwanted unblocking when addresses are blocked at a
100	      too fine-granular level (e.g. /128).  All these issues apply to
101	      throttling as well.  [I-D.ietf-opsec-ipv6-addressing] also raises
102	      this issue.

104	   *  Rate limiting/CAPTCHAs: A similar issue arises on the Web, where
105	      neighboring prefixes might be thrown together (e.g. in the same
106	      /48 or /56, even though the ISP hands out /64s), which leads to
107	      people "jointly" running into rate limits and then either being
108	      blocked from a service or having to solve annoying CAPTCHAs.

110	   *  Geolocation: Getting the right prefix size for IPv6 geolocation is
111	      similarly hard.  If you aggregate too much, you throw together
112	      different clients in different locations, and if you aggregate too
113	      little, you fill up the geolocation database with unnecessary
114	      entries.

116	   This document specifies how to augment the Routing Policy
117	   Specification Language (RPSL) [RFC2725] inetnum: class to refer
118	   specifically to prefixlen files and how to use them.  In all places
119	   inetnum: is used, inet6num: should also be assumed [RFC4012].

121	   The reader may find [INETNUM] and [INET6NUM] informative, and
122	   certainly more verbose, descriptions of the inetnum: database
123	   classes.

125	   An optional means for authenticating prefixlen data is also defined
126	   in Section 6.

128	2.  Requirements Language

130	   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
131	   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
132	   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
133	   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
134	   capitals, as shown here.

136	3.  prefixlen Files

138	   prefixlen files are CSV (Comma Separated Values) files in UTF-8
139	   [RFC3629] text format; not HTML, richtext, or other formats.  Lines
140	   MUST be delimited by a line break (CRLF), and blank lines MUST be
141	   ignored.  Text from a '#' character to the end of the current line
142	   MUST be treated as a comment only and is similarly ignored.  The
143	   first field of each non-ignored line specifies the prefix in
144	   question, the second field the end-site prefix length within that
145	   prefix as an integer, and the third field the number of end-sites
146	   within an end-site prefix length for networks using Carrier-Grade NAT
147	   (CGN) [RFC6598].  Note that all three fields MUST be present.  This
148	   means there MUST be exactly two commas in each non-commented line
149	   delimiting the three fields.  The first field MUST NOT be empty on
150	   lines which are not comments, while the second and third field can be
151	   empty in certain scenarios.

153	3.1.  End-site prefix length without CGN or proxies

155	   If an ISP delegates /56 IPv6 prefixes of the 2001:db8::/32 range, and
156	   /32 IPv4 prefixes (i.e. a single IPv4 address) of the 192.0.2.0/24
157	   range to its customers without the use of Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN)
158	   [RFC6598] or proxy techniques, it would create a prefix length file
159	   containing the following example entries:

161	       2001:db8::/32,56,1
162	       192.0.2.0/24,32,1

164	   Note the third field being set to '1', which signals the absence of
165	   CGN or proxies.

167	3.2.  End-site prefix length with CGN or proxies

169	   prefixlen files can also be used to signal the presence of Carrier-
170	   Grade NAT (CGN) [RFC6598] or proxies in networks.  This is especially
171	   useful for cases where multiple end-sites behind a CGN or proxy
172	   service accessing a service at the same time might run into rate
173	   limiting issues by service providers.  In case a prefixlen file
174	   signals the presence of a CGN, service providers can treat these
175	   prefixes in a way that rate limits are adjusted.  To signal the
176	   presence of a CGN, the number of CGN end-sites are specified in the
177	   third field.  For example, a CGN prefix 192.0.2.0/24 containing 4000
178	   CGN end sites would be specified as follows:

180	       192.0.2.0/24,24,4000

182	   Note the second field in the above example set to '24', signaling
183	   that the 4000 CGN end-sites are present in the complete 192.0.2.0/24
184	   prefix.

186	   If on the other hand these 4000 CGN end-sites are distributed 1000
187	   each in the four /26 sub-prefixes within 192.0.2.0/24, this is
188	   specified as follows:

190	       192.0.2.0/24,26,1000

192	   It is important to note that the third field denoting the number of
193	   CGN end-sites is referring to the prefix length specified in the
194	   second field.

196	   Note that this specification can be applied to IPv6 networks as well.

198	3.3.  Not specifying any end-site prefix length

200	   If an ISP delegates /32 IPv4 prefixes (i.e. a single IPv4 address) of
201	   the 192.0.2.0/24 range to its customers without the use of Carrier-
202	   Grade NAT (CGN), and it has a special sub-prefix 192.0.2.0/28 where
203	   this policy does not apply, it can signal so with the following
204	   prefix length file:

206	       192.0.2.0/24,32,
207	       192.0.2.0/28,,

209	   If both the second and third fields are empty, this means that the
210	   publisher does not want to disclose any prefix length information.
211	   Any prefix length information from covering prefixes (192.0.2.0/24 in
212	   our example) MUST be discarded for sub-prefixes specified in
213	   prefixlen files (192.0.2.0/28 in our example).

215	3.4.  Longest prefix matching

217	   Prefix length files can contain sub-prefixes entries of a parent
218	   prefix, which needs to be taken into account when processing these
219	   files.  For example, if a cloud provider assigns /120 IPv6 prefixes
220	   to each customer VM and a /64 prefix to premium customers, it would
221	   create a prefix length file containing the following example entries:

223	       2001:db8::/32,120,
224	       2001:db8:abcd::/48,64,

226	   Note that the second entry in the above example is a subprefix of the
227	   first entry.  Therefore, longest prefix matching has to be performed
228	   when parsing prefixlen files.

230	3.5.  Processing prefixlen files

232	   Multiple entries with exactly the same prefix MUST be considered an
233	   error, and consumer implementations SHOULD log the repeated entries
234	   for further administrative review.  Publishers SHOULD take measures
235	   to ensure there is one and only one entry per prefix.

237	   Upon encountering an erroneous entry in a prefixlen file, consumer
238	   implementations SHOULD skip that entry, log the error, and continue
239	   processing the remaining entries.

241	   Content providers and other parties who wish to differentiate
242	   services based on end site prefixes need to find the relevant
243	   prefixlen data.  In Section 4, this document specifies how to find
244	   the relevant prefixlen file given an IP address.

246	   prefixlen data for large providers with significant horizontal scale
247	   and high granularity can be quite large.  The size of a file can be
248	   even larger if an unsigned prefixlen file combines data for many
249	   prefixes, if dual IPv4/IPv6 spaces are represented, etc.

251	   This document also suggests an optional signature to strongly
252	   authenticate the data in the prefixlen files.  The same approach to
253	   signatures is used in this document that was used in [RFC9632].

255	4.  inetnum: Class

257	   The original RPSL specifications starting with [RIPE81], [RIPE181],
258	   and a trail of subsequent documents were written by the RIPE
259	   community.  The IETF standardized RPSL in [RFC2622] and [RFC4012].
260	   Since then, it has been modified and extensively enhanced in the
261	   Regional Internet Registry (RIR) community, mostly by RIPE [RIPE-DB].
262	   At the time of publishing this document, change control of RPSL
263	   effectively lies in the operator community.

265	   The RPSL, and [RFC2725] and [RFC4012] used by the Regional Internet
266	   Registries (RIRs), specify the inetnum: database class.  Each of
267	   these objects describes an IP address range and its attributes.  The
268	   inetnum: objects form a hierarchy ordered on the address space.

270	   Ideally, RPSL would be augmented to define a new RPSL prefixlen:
271	   attribute in the inetnum: class.  Absent implementation of the
272	   prefixlen: attribute in a particular RIR database, this document
273	   defines the syntax of a prefixlen remarks: attribute, which contains
274	   an HTTPS URL of a prefixlen file.  The format of the inetnum:
275	   prefixlen remarks: attribute MUST be as in this example, "remarks:
276	   Prefixlen ", where the token "Prefixlen" MUST be case-sensitive,
277	   followed by a URL that will vary, but it MUST refer only to a single
278	   prefixlen file.

280	       inetnum: 192.0.2.0/24 # example
281	       remarks: Prefixlen https://example.com/prefixlen

283	   While we leave global agreement of RPSL modification to the relevant
284	   parties, we specify that a proper prefixlen: attribute in the
285	   inetnum: class MUST be "prefixlen:" and MUST be followed by a single
286	   URL that will vary, but it MUST refer only to a single prefixlen
287	   file.

289	       inetnum: 192.0.2.0/24 # example
290	       prefixlen: https://example.com/prefixlen

292	   The URL uses HTTPS, so the WebPKI provides authentication, integrity,
293	   and confidentiality for the fetched prefixlen file.  However, the
294	   WebPKI can not provide authentication of IP address space assignment.
295	   In contrast, the RPKI (see [RFC6481]) can be used to authenticate IP
296	   space assignment; see optional authentication in Section 6.

298	   An approach to introduce a new RPSL attribute of type extref: for
299	   generic external references is described in
300	   [I-D.ymbk-opsawg-rpsl-extref].  With this extref approach a prefixlen
301	   can be referenced as follows:

303	             inetnum: 192.0.2.0/24 # example
304	             extref: Prefixlen https://example.com/prefixlen

306	   Until all producers of inetnum: objects, i.e., the RIRs, state that
307	   they have migrated to supporting a prefixlen: or extref: attribute,
308	   consumers looking at inetnum: objects to find prefixlen URLs MUST be
309	   able to consume the remarks:, prefixlen:, and extref: forms.

311	   The migration not only implies that the RIRs support the prefixlen:
312	   or extref: attributes, but that all registrants have migrated any
313	   inetnum: objects from remarks: to prefixlen: or extref: attributes.

315	   Any particular inetnum: object SHOULD have, at most, one prefixlen
316	   reference, whether a remarks:, extref:, or prefixlen: attribute when
317	   it is implemented.  As the remarks: form can not be formally checked
318	   by the RIR, this can not be formally enforced.  A prefixlen: or
319	   extref: attribute is preferred, of course, if the RIR supports it.
320	   If there is more than one type of attribute in the inetnum: object,
321	   the prefixlen: attribute MUST be prioritized over the extref:
322	   attribute and the extref: attribute MUST be prioritized over the
323	   remarks: attribute.

325	   For inetnum: instances covering the same address range, a signed
326	   prefixlen file MUST be preferred over an unsigned file.  If none are
327	   signed, or more than one is signed, the (signed) inetnum: with the
328	   most recent last-modified: attribute MUST be preferred.

330	   If a prefixlen file describes multiple disjoint ranges of IP address
331	   space, there are likely to be prefixlen references from multiple
332	   inetnum: objects.  Files with prefixlen references from multiple
333	   inetnum: objects are not compatible with the signing procedure in
334	   Section 6.

336	   An unsigned, and only an unsigned, prefixlen file MAY be referenced
337	   by multiple inetnum: instances and MAY contain prefixes from more
338	   than one registry.

340	   When fetching, the most specific inetnum: object with a prefixlen
341	   reference MUST be used.

343	   It is significant that prefixlen data may have finer granularity than
344	   the inetnum: that refers to them.  For example, an inetnum: object
345	   for an address range P could refer to a prefixlen file in which P has
346	   been subdivided into one or more longer prefixes.

348	   Backward compatibility issues regarding the implementation of new
349	   RPSL attributes are covered by Section 10.2 of [RFC2622].

351	5.  Fetching prefixlen Data

353	   This document provides a guideline for how interested parties should
354	   fetch and read prefixlen files.

356	   To minimize the load on RIRs' WHOIS [RFC3912] services, the RIR's FTP
357	   [RFC0959] services SHOULD be used for large-scale access to gather
358	   inetnum: instances with prefixlen references.  This uses efficient
359	   bulk access instead of fetching via brute-force search through the IP
360	   space.

362	   On the other hand, RIRs are converging on RDAP support which includes
363	   geofeed data, see [I-D.ietf-regext-rdap-geofeed].  It is hoped that
364	   this will be extended, or generalized, to support prefixlen data.

366	   When reading data from an unsigned prefixlen file, one MUST ignore
367	   data outside the referring inetnum: object's address range.  This is
368	   to avoid importing data about ranges not under the control of the
369	   operator.  Note that signed files MUST only contain prefixes within
370	   the referring inetnum:'s range as mandated in Section 6.

372	   If prefixlen files are fetched, other prefix length information from
373	   the inetnum: MUST be ignored.

375	   Given an address range of interest, the most specific inetnum: object
376	   with a prefixlen reference MUST be used to fetch the prefixlen file.
377	   For example, if the fetching party finds the following inetnum:
378	   objects:

380	       inetnum: 192.0.2.0/24 # example
381	       remarks: Prefixlen https://example.com/prefixlen_1

383	       inetnum: 192.0.2.0/26 # example
384	       remarks: Prefixlen https://example.com/prefixlen_2

386	   An application looking for prefixlen data for 192.0.2.0/29, MUST
387	   ignore data in prefixlen_1 because 192.0.2.0/29 is within the more
388	   specific 192.0.2.0/26 inetnum: covering that address range and that
389	   inetnum: does have a prefixlen reference.

391	6.  Authenticating prefixlen Data (Optional)

393	   The question arises whether a particular prefixlen data set is valid,
394	   i.e., is authorized by the "owner" of the IP address space and is
395	   authoritative in some sense.  The inetnum: that points to the
396	   prefixlen file provides some assurance.  Unfortunately, the RPSL in
397	   some repositories is weakly authenticated at best.  An approach where
398	   RPSL was signed per [RFC7909] would be good, except it would have to
399	   be deployed by all RPSL registries, and there is a fair number of
400	   them.

402	   The remainder of this section specifies an optional authenticator for
403	   the prefixlen data set that follows the Signed Object Template for
404	   the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) [RFC6488].

406	   A single optional authenticator MAY be appended to a prefixlen file.
407	   It is a digest of the main body of the file signed by the private key
408	   of the relevant RPKI certificate for a covering address range.  The
409	   following format bundles the relevant RPKI certificate with a
410	   signature over the prefixlen text.

412	   The canonicalization procedure converts the data from their internal
413	   character representation to the UTF-8 [RFC3629] character encoding,
414	   and the <CRLF> sequence MUST be used to denote the end of each line
415	   of text.  A blank line is represented solely by the <CRLF> sequence.
416	   For robustness, any non-printable characters MUST NOT be changed by
417	   canonicalization.  Trailing blank lines MUST NOT appear at the end of
418	   the file.  That is, the file must not end with multiple consecutive
419	   <CRLF> sequences.  Any end-of-file marker used by an operating system
420	   is not considered to be part of the file content.  When present, such
421	   end-of-file markers MUST NOT be covered by the digital signature.

423	   If the authenticator is not in the canonical form described above,
424	   then, the authenticator is invalid.

426	   Borrowing detached signatures from [RFC5485], after file
427	   canonicalization, the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) [RFC5652] is
428	   used to create a detached DER-encoded signature that is then Base64
429	   encoded with padding (as defined in Section 4 of [RFC4648]) and line
430	   wrapped to 72 or fewer characters.  The same digest algorithm MUST be
431	   used for calculating the message digest of the content being signed,
432	   which is the prefixlen file, and for calculating the message digest
433	   on the SignerInfo SignedAttributes [RFC8933].  The message digest
434	   algorithm identifier MUST appear in both the CMS SignedData
435	   DigestAlgorithmIdentifiers and the SignerInfo
436	   DigestAlgorithmIdentifier [RFC5652].  The RPKI certificate covering
437	   the prefixlen inetnum: object's address range is included in the CMS
438	   SignedData certificates field [RFC5652].

440	   The address range of the signing certificate MUST cover all prefixes
441	   in the signed prefixlen file.  If not, the authenticator is invalid.

443	   The signing certificate MUST NOT include the Autonomous System
444	   Identifier Delegation certificate extension [RFC3779].  If it is
445	   present, the authenticator is invalid.

447	   As with many other RPKI signed objects, the IP Address Delegation
448	   certificate extension MUST NOT use the "inherit" capability defined
449	   in Section 2.2.3.5 of [RFC3779].  If "inherit" is used, the
450	   authenticator is invalid.

452	   An IP Address Delegation extension using "inherit" would complicate
453	   processing.  The implementation would have to build the certification
454	   path from the end-entity to the trust anchor, then validate the path
455	   from the trust anchor to the end-entity, and then the parameter would
456	   have to be remembered when the validated public key was used to
457	   validate a signature on a CMS object.  Having to remember things from
458	   certification path validation for use with CMS object processing
459	   would be quite complex and error-prone.  And, the certificates do not
460	   get that much bigger by repeating the information.

462	   An address range A "covers" address range B if the range of B is
463	   identical to or a subset of A.  "Address range" is used here because
464	   inetnum: objects and RPKI certificates need not align on Classless
465	   Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) [RFC4632] prefix boundaries, while those
466	   of the lines in a prefixlen file do align.

468	   The Certification Authority (CA) MUST generate a new End Entity (EE)
469	   certificate for each signing of a particular prefixlen file.  The
470	   private key associated with the EE certificate SHOULD sign only one
471	   prefixlen file.  That is, a new key pair SHOULD be generated for each
472	   new version of a particular prefixlen file.  When the EE certificate
473	   is used in this fashion, it is termed a "one-time-use" EE certificate
474	   (see Section 3 of [RFC6487]).

476	   On the other hand, verifying the signature has no similar complexity;
477	   the certificate, which is validated in the RPKI, contains the needed
478	   public key.  The RPKI trust anchors for the RIRs are available to the
479	   party performing signature validation.  Validation of the CMS
480	   signature over the prefixlen file involves:

482	   1.  Obtaining the signer's certificate from the CMS SignedData
483	       CertificateSet [RFC5652].  The certificate SubjectKeyIdentifier
484	       extension [RFC5280] MUST match the SubjectKeyIdentifier in the
485	       CMS SignerInfo SignerIdentifier [RFC5652].  If the key
486	       identifiers do not match, then validation MUST fail.

488	   2.  Validating the signer's certificate MUST ensure that it is part
489	       of the current [RFC9286] manifest and that all resources are
490	       covered by the RPKI certificate.

492	   3.  Construct and validate the certification path for the signer's
493	       certificate.  All of the needed certificates are expected to be
494	       readily available in the RPKI repository.  The certification path
495	       MUST be valid according to the validation algorithm in [RFC5280]
496	       and the additional checks specified in [RFC3779] associated with
497	       the IP Address Delegation certificate extension.  If
498	       certification path validation is unsuccessful, then validation
499	       MUST fail.

501	   4.  Validating the CMS SignedData as specified in [RFC5652] using the
502	       public key from the validated signer's certificate.  If the
503	       signature validation is unsuccessful, then validation MUST fail.

505	   5.  Confirming that the eContentType object identifier (OID) is id-
506	       ct-prefixlenCSVwithCRLF (1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1.TBD).  This OID
507	       MUST appear within both the eContentType in the encapContentInfo
508	       object and the ContentType signed attribute in the signerInfo
509	       object (see [RFC6488]).

511	   6.  Verifying that the IP Address Delegation certificate extension
512	       [RFC3779] covers all of the address ranges of the prefixlen file.
513	       If all of the address ranges are not covered, then validation
514	       MUST fail.

516	   All of the above steps MUST be successful to consider the prefixlen
517	   file signature as valid.

519	   The authenticator MUST be hidden as a series of "#" comments at the
520	   end of the prefixlen file.  The following simple example is
521	   cryptographically incorrect:

523	       # RPKI Signature: 192.0.2.0 - 192.0.2.255
524	       # MIIGlwYJKoZIhvcNAQcCoIIGiDCCBoQCAQMxDTALBglghkgBZQMEAgEwDQYLKoZ
525	       # IhvcNAQkQAS+gggSxMIIErTCCA5WgAwIBAgIUJ605QIPX8rW5m4Zwx3WyuW7hZu
526	       ...
527	       # imwYkXpiMxw44EZqDjl36MiWsRDLdgoijBBcGbibwyAfGeR46k5raZCGvxG+4xa
528	       # O8PDTxTfIYwAnBjRBKAqAZ7yX5xHfm58jUXsZJ7Ileq1S7G6Kk=
529	       # End Signature: 192.0.2.0 - 192.0.2.255

531	   A correct and full example is in Appendix A.

533	   The CMS signature does not cover the signature lines.

535	   The bracketing "# RPKI Signature:" and "# End Signature:" MUST be
536	   present as shown in the example.  The RPKI Signature's IP address
537	   range MUST match that of the prefixlen URL in the inetnum: that
538	   points to the prefixlen file.

540	7.  Operational Considerations

542	   To create the needed inetnum: objects, an operator wishing to
543	   register the location of their prefixlen file needs to coordinate
544	   with their Regional Internet Registry (RIR) or National Internet
545	   Registry (NIR) and/or any provider Local Internet Registry (LIR) that
546	   has assigned address ranges to them.  RIRs/NIRs provide means for
547	   assignees to create and maintain inetnum: objects.  They also provide
548	   means of assigning or sub-assigning IP address resources and allowing
549	   the assignee to create WHOIS data, including inetnum: objects,
550	   thereby referring to prefixlen files.

552	   The prefixlen files MUST be published via and fetched using HTTPS
553	   [RFC9110].

555	   When using data from a prefixlen file, one MUST ignore data outside
556	   the referring inetnum: object's inetnum: attribute address range.

558	   If and only if the prefixlen file is not signed per Section 6, then
559	   multiple inetnum: objects MAY refer to the same prefixlen file, and
560	   the consumer MUST use only lines in the prefixlen file where the
561	   prefix is covered by the address range of the inetnum: object's URL
562	   it has followed.

564	   If the prefixlen file is signed, and the signer's certificate is
565	   replaced with another certificate, then the signature in the
566	   prefixlen file MUST be updated so that it can be properly validated
567	   with the new certificate.

569	   It is good key hygiene to use a given key for only one purpose.  To
570	   dedicate a signing private key for signing a prefixlen file, an RPKI
571	   Certification Authority (CA) may issue a subordinate certificate
572	   exclusively for the purpose shown in Appendix A.

574	   Harvesting and publishing aggregated prefixlen data outside of the
575	   RPSL model SHOULD be avoided as it can have the effect that more
576	   specifics from one aggregatee could undesirably affect the less
577	   specifics of a different aggregatee.  Moreover, publishing aggregated
578	   prefixlen data prevents the reader of the data to perform the checks
579	   described in Section 5 and Section 6.

581	   An anonymized version of bulk WHOIS data is openly available for all
582	   RIRs except ARIN, which requires an authorization.  However, for
583	   users without such authorization, the same result can be achieved
584	   with extra RDAP effort.  There is open-source code to pass over such
585	   data across all RIRs, collect all prefixlen references, and process
586	   them [PREFIXLEN-FINDER].

588	   To prevent undue load on RPSL and prefixlen servers, entity-fetching
589	   prefixlen data using these mechanisms MUST NOT do frequent real-time
590	   lookups. prefixlen servers SHOULD send an HTTP Expires header
591	   [RFC9111] to signal when prefixlen data should be refetched.  If an
592	   HTTP Expires or Cache-Control header is present, it MUST be honored
593	   by clients.  As the data change very infrequently, in the absence of
594	   such an HTTP header signal, collectors SHOULD NOT fetch more
595	   frequently than weekly.  It would be polite not to fetch at magic
596	   times such as midnight UTC, the first of the month, etc., because too
597	   many others are likely to do the same.

599	8.  Implementation Status

601	   At the time of publishing this document, the prefixlen: attribute in
602	   inetnum objects has not yet been implemented by any RIR database.

604	   Registrants in databases which do not yet support the prefixlen:
605	   attribute are using the remarks:, or equivalent, attribute.

607	   At the time of publishing this document, the registry data published
608	   by ARIN are not the same RPSL as that of the other registries (see
609	   [RFC7485] for a survey of the WHOIS Tower of Babel); therefore, when
610	   fetching from ARIN via FTP [RFC0959], WHOIS [RFC3912], the
611	   Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) [RFC9082], etc., the
612	   "NetRange" attribute/key must be treated as "inetnum", and the
613	   "Comment" attribute must be treated as "remarks".

615	   [rpki-client] can be used to authenticate a signed prefixlen file.

617	9.  Security Considerations

619	   The consumer of prefixlen data SHOULD fetch and process the data
620	   themselves.  Importing datasets produced and/or processed by a third
621	   party places significant trust in the third party.

623	   As mentioned in Section 6, some RPSL repositories have weak, if any,
624	   authentication.  This allows spoofing of inetnum: objects pointing to
625	   malicious prefixlen files.  Section 6 suggests an unfortunately
626	   complex method for stronger authentication based on the RPKI.

628	   For example, if an inetnum: for a wide address range (e.g., a /16)
629	   points to an RPKI-signed prefixlen file, a customer or attacker could
630	   publish an unsigned equal or narrower (e.g., a /24) inetnum: in a
631	   WHOIS registry that has weak authorization, abusing the rule that the
632	   most-specific inetnum: object with a prefixlen reference MUST be
633	   used.

635	   If signatures were mandatory, the above attack would be stymied, but
636	   of course that is not happening anytime soon.

638	   The RPSL providers have had to throttle fetching from their servers
639	   due to too-frequent queries.  Usually, they throttle by the querying
640	   IP address or block.  Similar defenses will likely need to be
641	   deployed by prefixlen file servers.

643	   As prefixlen files disclose which parts of a prefix belong to an end
644	   site, attackers could better focus DDoS traffic towards a website
645	   hosted by a cloud provider by overwhelming only IP addresses from
646	   that specific end site.  Furthermore, information collected from
647	   prefixlen files could allow for more targeted IPv6 scanning/
648	   reconnaissance, where scanners (be it benevolent or malicious ones)
649	   can target specific sub-prefixes which they deem more interesting.

651	   It is possible for publishers of prefixlen data to specify incorrect
652	   prefixlen data about their prefixes.  This could either be done by
653	   mistake or on purpose.  One example could be a malicious network
654	   operator trying to overflow the storage of databases that consume
655	   prefixlen data by setting a very specific prefix size (e.g., /128 for
656	   large blocks of IPv6 address space).  In another example a network
657	   operator might annotate their prefixes as using CGN to go around
658	   legitimate blocking or throttling.  A third example would be a
659	   malicious provider publishing fake small allocations, so on receipt
660	   of complaints, they could plausibly respond by saying that they
661	   stopped the actions of a bad customer and move their malicious
662	   activities to a different prefix.  As a fourth example, network
663	   operators could overwhelm consumers by publishing prefixlen files
664	   containing millions or even billions of entries (e.g., enumerating
665	   all possible /96 subprefixes of a /32 IPv6 prefix).  Therefore, care
666	   should be taken when processing prefixlen data, as with any external
667	   third-party data.

669	10.  IANA Considerations

671	   IANA is asked to register object identifiers for one content type in
672	   the "SMI Security for S/MIME CMS Content Type
673	   (1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1)" registry as follows:

675	   Description             OID                         Specification
676	   -----------------------------------------------------------------
677	   id-ct-prefixlenCSVwithCRLF  1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1.47  [RFC-TBD]

679	   In the SMI Security for S/MIME CMS Content Type
680	   (1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1) in the Structure of Management Information
681	   (SMI) Numbers (MIB Module Registrations) registry group located at:
682	   https://www.iana.org/assignments/smi-numbers/ there is no existing
683	   registration for prefixlen files yet.  On publication of this
684	   document, that reference needs to be changed to the new [ RFC-to-be
685	   ].

687	11.  Acknowledgments

893	Appendix A.  Example

895	   This appendix provides an example, including a trust anchor, a
896	   Certificate Revocation List (CRL) signed by the trust anchor, a CA
897	   certificate subordinate to the trust anchor, a CRL signed by the CA,
898	   an end-entity certificate subordinate to the CA for signing the
899	   prefixlen, and a detached signature.

901	   The trust anchor is represented by a self-signed certificate.  As
902	   usual in the RPKI, the trust anchor has authority over all IPv4
903	   address blocks, all IPv6 address blocks, and all Autonomous System
904	   (AS) numbers.
