## Document History

1. Does the working group (WG) consensus represent the strong concurrence of a
few individuals, with others being silent, or did it reach broad agreement?

Shepherd:
This document has been discussed extensively on the mailing list. The WG
consensus represents the strong concurrence of a small amount of individuals
with the other folks giving comments and suggestions on the changes of the
document. No objections for publication or other comments were raised for the
WGLC. Here is a direct link to that WGLC process:
<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/netmod/u5Vk7_DgeXAOuq4h02hROfTYQaU/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/netmod/u5Vk7_DgeXAOuq4h02hROfTYQaU/</a>

As such, the shepherd believes that this document has reached a broad agreement
as this WG would be expected to reach.

2. Was there controversy about particular points, or were there decisions where
the consensus was particularly rough?

Shepherd:
There was no controversy about particular points, and the shepherd doesn’t
notice any decisions where the consensus was particularly rough.

3. Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If
so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the
responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this
questionnaire is publicly available.)

Shepherd:
No one threatened an appeal or indicated extreme discontent.

4. For protocol documents, are there existing implementations of the contents of
the document? Have a significant number of potential implementers indicated
plans to implement? Are any existing implementations reported somewhere,
either in the document itself (as [<a href="/doc/rfc7942/">RFC 7942</a>][3] recommends) or elsewhere
(where)?

Shepherd:
This document is not a protocol document. Instead, it provides guidelines for
authors and reviewers of documents that contain YANG data models. The shepherd
does not believe that this document pertains to any implementations.

## Additional Reviews

5. Do the contents of this document closely interact with technologies in other
IETF working groups or external organizations, and would it therefore benefit
from their review? Have those reviews occurred? If yes, describe which
reviews took place.

Shepherd:
The document was reviewed by IANA and their inputs adequately implemented.
Also, the document was circulated in SAAG mailing list to solicit reviews for
the security template. Here is a direct link to that security template
discussion on SAAG list:
<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/saag/z338jOL6mpYIIzT0Xk8ioCvi6v4/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/saag/z338jOL6mpYIIzT0Xk8ioCvi6v4/</a>.

Besides that, the shepherd doesn't think the contents of this document closely
interact with technologies in other fields, and therefore the shepherd doesn't
believe this document needs further review from other IETF working groups or
external organizations.

6. Describe how the document meets any required formal expert review criteria,
such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.

Shepherd:
The document went through a YANG doctor review as part of the Last Call process.
Here is a direct link to that review:
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/review-ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis-11-yangdoctors-lc-liu-2024-06-17/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/review-ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis-11-yangdoctors-lc-liu-2024-06-17/</a>
And all the comments raised by the YANG doctor were resolved by authors
providing suggested texts for the YANG doctor to review, here is the related
discussion about the Yang doctor last call review on the NETMOD WG mailing
list:
<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/yang-doctors/QFNwJC99AtorujtQLPtsRQZDVP8/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/yang-doctors/QFNwJC99AtorujtQLPtsRQZDVP8/</a>
In addition, the shepherd confirms that the follow-up comment raised by the
YANG doctor was also fixed.

Specifically, the document also went through a TSVART review which was
considered by the WG, but the rough consensus from the WG was not to adopt the
changes as suggested. Here is a direct link to that review:
<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/netmod/QcAw9pagRaSHRvQpq8fGExRqtHE/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/netmod/QcAw9pagRaSHRvQpq8fGExRqtHE/</a> And
here is a direct link to the related discussion within WG:
<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/netmod/KJoBZCXsf-2YE2r2yw_WmcVrP6I/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/netmod/KJoBZCXsf-2YE2r2yw_WmcVrP6I/</a>

7. If the document contains a YANG module, has the final version of the module
been checked with any of the [recommended validation tools][4] for syntax and
formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is
the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module
comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified
in [<a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC 8342</a>][5]?

Shepherd:
The document contains some example and template modules without any substantive
definition and only for illustration purposes, YANG tools cannot validate them
directly since some contents need to be replaced according to actual
situations. The shepherd doesn’t think there is any syntax and formatting
issues.

Note that DataTracker’s YANG validator reports 4 errors and 5 warnings which
are considered as false positives by the shepherd since they are about some
fields that need to be replaced with real contents in the template modules.

8. Describe reviews and automated checks performed to validate sections of the
final version of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code,
BNF rules, MIB definitions, CBOR's CDDL, etc.

Shepherd:
The shepherd has reviewed the document, tested it against “idnits”. The
document doesn’t contain any other parts that needs to be validated except for
some YANG fragment, which have been checked by the shepherd.

## Document Shepherd Checks

9. Based on the shepherd's review of the document, is it their opinion that this
document is needed, clearly written, complete, correctly designed, and ready
to be handed off to the responsible Area Director?

Shepherd:
Yes. Based on the shepherd's review of the document, the shepherd believes that
this document is needed, clearly written, complete, correctly designed, and
ready to be handed off to the responsible Area Director.

10. Several IETF Areas have assembled [lists of common issues that their
reviewers encounter][6]. For which areas have such issues been identified
and addressed? For which does this still need to happen in subsequent
reviews?

Shepherd:
The shepherd doesn’t see any common issues that need to be flagged. The
shepherd believes that there is nothing that would merit specific attention
from subsequent reviews.

11. What type of RFC publication is being requested on the IETF stream ([Best
Current Practice][12], [Proposed Standard, Internet Standard][13],
[Informational, Experimental or Historic][14])? Why is this the proper type
of RFC? Do all Datatracker state attributes correctly reflect this intent?

Shepherd:
This document is requested to be published as Best Current Practice. In this
case, it is the correct state because this document defines some guidelines and
obsoletes <a href="/doc/rfc8407/">RFC 8407</a>, which is also published as Best Current Practice.

The status is properly reflected on the Datatracker page, here is the direct
link: <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis/</a>.

12. Have reasonable efforts been made to remind all authors of the intellectual
property rights (IPR) disclosure obligations described in [<a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a>][7]? To
the best of your knowledge, have all required disclosures been filed? If
not, explain why. If yes, summarize any relevant discussion, including links
to publicly-available messages when applicable.

Shepherd:
No IPR disclosure has been filed that references this document.

The WG chair has requested an IPR call on the list. All authors confirmed that
they are not aware of any IPR related to this document. All responses indicated
no IPR needs to be disclosed.

Here is the directed link to the IPR call request:
<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/netmod/B9cnRJcAt-Gr1HnwQkM7RiWgHhY/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/netmod/B9cnRJcAt-Gr1HnwQkM7RiWgHhY/</a>
<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/netmod/NDygxJmY6FEOwXS8ifGo08INR58/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/netmod/NDygxJmY6FEOwXS8ifGo08INR58/</a>

13. Has each author, editor, and contributor shown their willingness to be
listed as such? If the total number of authors and editors on the front page
is greater than five, please provide a justification.

Shepherd:
There are 3 authors (no greater than 5) for this document and no contributor
being listed. Each author did not confirmed their willingness to be listed as
such explicitly, but the shepherd assumes that all three of authors have been
listed for some time and their silence implies consent. And all responded to
the IPR polling during WGLC, which also implies that they are aware of their
status on the document.

14. Document any remaining I-D nits in this document. Simply running the [idnits
tool][8] is not enough; please review the ["Content Guidelines" on
<a href="http://authors.ietf.org">authors.ietf.org</a>][15]. (Also note that the current idnits tool generates
some incorrect warnings; a rewrite is underway.)

Shepherd:
I-D nits has been tested against -22, and it reports 1 error (**), 0 flaws
(~~), 2 warnings (==), 5 comments (--), which are either innocuous or
intentional. Note the normative reference to <a href="/doc/rfc8792/">RFC 8792</a> is not an error as it is
listed in the Downref registry (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/downref">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/downref</a>).
Manual check of Guidelines to Authors of Internet-Drafts reveals no issues.

15. Should any informative references be normative or vice-versa? See the [IESG
Statement on Normative and Informative References][16].

Shepherd:
The shepherd has reviewed that all references within this document have been
identified as either normative or informative, and all the informative and
normative references are classified correctly.

16. List any normative references that are not freely available to anyone. Did
the community have sufficient access to review any such normative
references?

Shepherd:
None. All the normative references in the document are freely available to
anyone.

17. Are there any normative downward references (see [<a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>][9] and [<a href="/doc/bcp97/">BCP
97</a>][10]) that are not already listed in the [DOWNREF registry][17]? If so,
list them.

Shepherd:
Yes, <a href="/doc/rfc8792/">RFC 8792</a>. However, that RFC is already listed in DOWNREF registry.

18. Are there normative references to documents that are not ready to be
submitted to the IESG for publication or are otherwise in an unclear state?
If so, what is the plan for their completion?

Shepherd:
There are no normative references to documents that are not ready to be
submitted to the IESG for publication or in an unclear state. All normative
references are published.

19. Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? If
so, does the Datatracker metadata correctly reflect this and are those RFCs
listed on the title page, in the abstract, and discussed in the
introduction? If not, explain why and point to the part of the document
where the relationship of this document to these other RFCs is discussed.

Shepherd:
The publication of this document will obsolete <a href="/doc/rfc8407/">RFC8407</a>, update RFCs 6020 and
8126. All of them are correctly reflected on the Datatracker metadata, document
title page, in the abstract and discussed in the introduction.

20. Describe the document shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section,
especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document.
Confirm that all aspects of the document requiring IANA assignments are
associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm
that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm
that each newly created IANA registry specifies its initial contents,
allocations procedures, and a reasonable name (see [<a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>][11]).

Shepherd:
The shepherd has reviewed the IANA considerations section, this document
registers two URIs and two YANG modules, it also requests IANA to update the
reference for the “YANG module Names” registry. Besides that, this document
also amends the guidance on names unicity of IANA considerations to register
YANG module and submodule names and add extra notes for the creation and
maintenance of an IANA-maintained module.

The shepherd confirms that all aspects of the document requiring IANA
assignments are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA
registries. The shepherd also confirms that any referenced IANA registries have
been clearly identified in the document, and it doesn’t contain any newly
created IANA registry.

In addition, IANA was solicited for feedback since early versions of the
document, e.g., 1. Individual submission: [netmod] TR: [IANA #1291942] RE:

21. List any new IANA registries that require Designated Expert Review for
future allocations. Are the instructions to the Designated Expert clear?
Please include suggestions of designated experts, if appropriate.

Shepherd:
This document does not have any new IANA registries that require Designated
Expert Review for future allocations.
