# Document Shepherd Write-Up for Group Documents

*This version is dated 4 July 2022.*

## Document History

1. Does the working group (WG) consensus represent the strong concurrence of a
few individuals, with others being silent, or did it reach broad agreement?

There is good consensus behind this document, specifically those actively
participating in the CATS WG. The document has been adopted as a WG item and
has progressed through several iterations based on WG list and meeting
feedback. Working Group Last Call ended on November 18, 2025.

The WG milestones only explicitly say to adopt this document (not to publish as
an RFC). However, the charter does not preclude this. The working group
discussed this point and had strong consensus that publication as an
Informational RFC would be helpful for future protocol work.

2. Was there controversy about particular points, or were there decisions where
the consensus was particularly rough?

There has been technical discussions, especially around alignment of
terminology with the CATS framework (definitions, roles, metrics). These issues
were resolved by updating the text. From the list no issues or controversies
remain. There were no areas where consensus was not clear at the time this
write-up was prepared but additional comments may be identified during Working
Group Last Call.

3. Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If
so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the
responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this
questionnaire is publicly available.)

No.

4. For protocol documents, are there existing implementations of the contents of
the document? Have a significant number of potential implementers indicated
plans to implement? Are any existing implementations reported somewhere,
either in the document itself (as [<a href="/doc/rfc7942/">RFC 7942</a>][3] recommends) or elsewhere
(where)?

No, none that have been shared with the working group.
This is an Informational document and, as it describes use cases and
requirements ahead of any solutions work, it would not qualify for
implementation.

## Additional Reviews

5. Do the contents of this document closely interact with technologies in other
IETF working groups or external organizations, and would it therefore benefit
from their review? Have those reviews occurred? If yes, describe which
reviews took place.

Not specifically, the use cases relate to the main CATS framework and metrics
documents and has been used as an input to them.

6. Describe how the document meets any required formal expert review criteria,
such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.

Not applicable. The document defines no MIB modules, YANG modules, media types,
URIs, or similar constructs

7. If the document contains a YANG module, has the final version of the module
been checked with any of the [recommended validation tools][4] for syntax and
formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is
the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module
comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified
in [<a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC 8342</a>][5]?

Not applicable. The document does not contain a YANG module.

8. Describe reviews and automated checks performed to validate sections of the
final version of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code,
BNF rules, MIB definitions, CBOR's CDDL, etc.

Not applicable. The document does not define any formal language artefacts.

## Document Shepherd Checks

9. Based on the shepherd's review of the document, is it their opinion that this
document is needed, clearly written, complete, correctly designed, and ready
to be handed off to the responsible Area Director?

In the shepherd’s opinion, this document is needed, clearly written, and
complete for its intended purpose. The -09 revision incorporates WG feedback
and addresses comments from the RTGDIR early review and is ready to be handed
to the responsible Area Director.

10. Several IETF Areas have assembled [lists of common issues that their
reviewers encounter][6]. For which areas have such issues been identified
and addressed? For which does this still need to happen in subsequent
reviews?

The shepherd has considered the routing-area and general IESG review
checklists. No area-specific issues have been identified beyond those already
covered by WG discussions and the RTGDIR early review. Any additional comments
from other areas (such as security and operations) can be performed by the IESG
members.

11. What type of RFC publication is being requested on the IETF stream ([Best
Current Practice][12], [Proposed Standard, Internet Standard][13],
[Informational, Experimental or Historic][14])? Why is this the proper type
of RFC? Do all Datatracker state attributes correctly reflect this intent?

The intended publication status is Informational. This is appropriate, as the
document provides the CATS problem statement, use cases, and requirements; it
does not define a protocol or mechanism. The Datatracker correctly records the
intended status as Informational.

12. Have reasonable efforts been made to remind all authors of the intellectual
property rights (IPR) disclosure obligations described in [<a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a>][7]? To
the best of your knowledge, have all required disclosures been filed? If
not, explain why. If yes, summarize any relevant discussion, including links
to publicly-available messages when applicable.

The shepherd (and WG chairs) have reminded all authors and key contributors of
their obligations under <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> and polled them via the CATS mailing list. All
authors and contributors have responded
(<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cats/oiyL5Kb0tvp6XDcB1uS-lnO4mhs/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cats/oiyL5Kb0tvp6XDcB1uS-lnO4mhs/</a>). To
the shepherd’s knowledge, there are no undisclosed IPR claims relating
specifically to this document; any filed disclosures, if present, are recorded
on the Datatracker IPR page for the draft.

13. Has each author, editor, and contributor shown their willingness to be
listed as such? If the total number of authors and editors on the front page
is greater than five, please provide a justification.

All listed authors and contributors have not publicly disclosed any
unwillingness to be named as such, and by responding to the IPR poll (above)
have indicated that they are aware of their roles. There are five authors,
which is within the usual guideline. Additional contributors are acknowledged
in the “Contributors” section of the document.

14. Document any remaining I-D nits in this document. Simply running the [idnits
tool][8] is not enough; please review the ["Content Guidelines" on
<a href="http://authors.ietf.org">authors.ietf.org</a>][15]. (Also note that the current idnits tool generates
some incorrect warnings; a rewrite is underway.)

The document passes the IETF Submission check with zero Errors. However there
is one warning: "There is 1 instance of lines with non-ascii characters in the
document." This occurs in someone's name.

15. Should any informative references be normative or vice-versa? See the [IESG
Statement on Normative and Informative References][16].

The split between normative and informative references appears appropriate.

16. List any normative references that are not freely available to anyone. Did
the community have sufficient access to review any such normative
references?

All normative references are IETF RFCs and freely available. There are no
paywalled or otherwise unavailable normative references

17. Are there any normative downward references (see [<a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>][9] and [<a href="/doc/bcp97/">BCP
97</a>][10]) that are not already listed in the [DOWNREF registry][17]? If so,
list them.

No.

18. Are there normative references to documents that are not ready to be
submitted to the IESG for publication or are otherwise in an unclear state?
If so, what is the plan for their completion?

No.

19. Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? If
so, does the Datatracker metadata correctly reflect this and are those RFCs
listed on the title page, in the abstract, and discussed in the
introduction? If not, explain why and point to the part of the document
where the relationship of this document to these other RFCs is discussed.

No.

20. Describe the document shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section,
especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document.
Confirm that all aspects of the document requiring IANA assignments are
associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm
that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm
that each newly created IANA registry specifies its initial contents,
allocations procedures, and a reasonable name (see [<a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>][11]).

No new IANA registries are defined.

21. List any new IANA registries that require Designated Expert Review for
future allocations. Are the instructions to the Designated Expert clear?
Please include suggestions of designated experts, if appropriate.
