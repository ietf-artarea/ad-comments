18	Abstract

20	   Distributed computing is a computing pattern that service providers
21	   can follow and use to achieve better service response time and
22	   optimized energy consumption.  In such a distributed computing
23	   environment, compute intensive and delay sensitive services can be
24	   improved by utilizing computing resources hosted in various computing
25	   facilities.  Ideally, compute services are balanced across servers
26	   and network resources to enable higher throughput and lower response
27	   time.  To achieve this, the choice of server and network resources
28	   should consider metrics that are oriented towards compute
29	   capabilities and resources instead of simply dispatching the service
30	   requests in a static way or optimizing solely on connectivity
31	   metrics.  The process of selecting servers or service instance
32	   locations, and of directing traffic to them on chosen network
33	   resources is called "Computing-Aware Traffic Steering" (CATS).

35	   This document provides the problem statement and the typical
36	   scenarios for CATS, which shows the necessity of considering more
37	   factors when steering traffic to the appropriate computing resource
38	   to better meet the customer's expectations.

111	1.  Introduction

113	   Network operators are increasingly deploying computing resources,
114	   with a focus on enhancing edge capabilities to support services
115	   requiring low latency, high reliability, and dynamic resource
116	   scaling.

118	   Diversified service demands have brought key challenges to service
119	   deployment and traffic scheduling.  A single-site service instance
120	   often lacks sufficient capacity to guarantee the required quality of
121	   service, especially during peak hours when local computing resources
122	   may fail to handle all incoming requests, leading to longer response
123	   times or even request drops.  Regular capacity expansion of a single
124	   site is neither practical nor economical.  Additionally, relying
125	   solely on end-side computing enhancements cannot meet the computing
126	   requirements of all applications.

128	   It is necessary to deploy services across multiple sites (either edge
129	   or central nodes) to improve availability and scalability.  To this
130	   end, traffic should be steered to the "best" service instance based
131	   on factors like current computing load, where "best" is largely
132	   determined by application requirements.

134	   However, existing routing schemes and traffic engineering methods
135	   fall short of addressing these challenges.  The underlying networking
136	   infrastructures that include computing resources usually provide
137	   relatively static service dispatching or depend solely on
138	   connectivity metrics for traffic steering, failing to account for
139	   compute capabilities and resource status, which are critical for
140	   meeting the quality requirements of modern services.

142	   To tackle this issue, the choice of service instance and network
143	   resources should further consider compute-oriented metrics beyond
144	   connectivity metrics.  The process of selecting service instances and
145	   locations based on metrics that are oriented towards compute
146	   capabilities and resources, and of directing traffic to them on
147	   chosen network resources is called "Computing-Aware Traffic Steering"
148	   (CATS).  It should be noted that CATS is not limited to edge
149	   computing scenarios, however, Section 3 of this document will focus
150	   on edge computing scenarios for problem statement.

152	   This document describes sample usage scenarios that drive CATS
153	   requirements and will help to identify candidate solution
154	   architectures and approaches.

156	2.  Definition of Terms

158	   This document uses the terms defined in [I-D.ietf-cats-framework],
159	   including service site, service instance, CATS service identifier(CS-
160	   ID).

162	   Edge Computing:  Edge computing is a computing pattern that moves
163	     computing infrastructures, i.e, servers, away from centralized data
164	     centers and instead places it close to the end users for low
165	     latency communication.

167	   Even though this document is not a protocol specification, it makes
168	   use of upper case key words to define requirements unambiguously.

170	   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
171	   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
172	   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
173	   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
174	   capitals, as shown here.

176	3.  Problem Statement

178	3.1.  Multi-deployment of Edge Service Sites and Service

180	   In edge computing environments, service instances typically adopt a
181	   multi-site deployment model.  It should be clarified that specific
182	   service instance deployment strategies are not within the scope of
183	   CATS.  However, it is undeniable that there is a close correlation
184	   between service instance deployment and traffic scheduling,
185	   especially in the definition and selection of core metrics such as
186	   computing capabilities and resources.  This dual applicability allows
187	   a common set of metrics to inform both traffic steering and higher-
188	   level service management decisions, without requiring CATS to define
189	   orchestration behavior.

191	   Therefore, to present a clear and comprehensive problem statement, it
192	   is necessary to first introduce the relevant considerations for
193	   multi-edge service site deployment.  This premise can better support
194	   the subsequent elaboration on CATS requirements and solutions.

196	   The core goal of edge computing is to provide computing services
197	   closer to users through shorter network paths.  Before deploying edge
198	   service sites, the following factors need to be considered:

200	   *  Geographic location: Including the number of users, differences in
201	      service types, and the number of connection requests from users.
202	      For edge service sites located in densely populated areas with a
203	      large number of users and service requests, more service replicas
204	      can be deployed compared to other areas.

206	   *  The type, scale, and usage frequency of required computing
207	      resources.  For example, distributed AI inference services require
208	      the deployment of more GPU resources.

210	   *  The status of network resources associated with computing
211	      resources, such as network topology, network access methods,
212	      connectivity, link bandwidth, and path protection or redundancy
213	      information.

215	   To improve the overall quality of service, during the service
216	   deployment phase, it is necessary to analyze the approximate network
217	   and computing resource requirements of the service, comprehensively
218	   form a reasonable network and computing resource topology, and
219	   clarify the location, overall distribution, and relative position of
220	   computing resources in the network topology.  This process relies on
221	   standardized consensus on computing and network resources related
222	   metrics, which is also the point most closely related to the problem
223	   space addressed by CATS traffic scheduling.

225	3.2.  Traffic Steering among Edges Service Sites and Service Instances

227	   This section describes how existing edge computing systems do not
228	   provide all of the support needed for real-time or near-real-time
229	   services, and how it is necessary to steer traffic to different sites
230	   considering changes in client distribution, different time slots,
231	   events, server loads, network capabilities, and some other factors
232	   which might not be directly measured, i.e., properties of edge
233	   service sites(e.g., geographical location), etc.

235	   It's assumed that service instances are multi-site deployed, and they
236	   are reachable through a network infrastructure.

238	   When a client issues a service request for a required service, the
239	   request is steered to one of the available service instances.  Each
240	   service instance may act as a client towards another service, thereby
241	   seeing its own outbound traffic steered to a suitable service
242	   instance of the requested service and so on, achieving service
243	   composition and chaining as a result.

245	   The aforementioned selection of a service instance from the set of
246	   candidates is performed using traffic steering methods.

248	   In edge computing, traffic is steered to an edge service site that is
249	   "closest" or to one of a few "close" sites using load-balancing.
250	   Such traffic steering can be initiated either by the application
251	   layer or by the network layer: the application layer may actively
252	   query for the optimal node and guide traffic using mechanisms such as
253	   the ALTO protocol[RFC7285], while the network layer may leverage
254	   Anycast routing[RFC4786], where routering systems automatically
255	   distribute traffic according to routing tables in an application-
256	   transparent manner.  However, regardless of whether the steering is
257	   performed by the application or the network, the core criteria for
258	   selecting "closest" or "close" sites often rely solely on
259	   communication metrics (such as physical distance, hop count, or
260	   network latency).  This decision logic can easily lead to suboptimal
261	   choices, meaning that the "closest" site is not always the "best"
262	   one.  This is because the computing resources and states of edge
263	   service sites can change in real time:

265	   *  The closest site may not have sufficient resources.

267	   *  The closest site may not have the specific computing resources
268	      required.

270	   To address these issues, enhancements to traffic steering mechanisms
271	   are needed to direct traffic to sites that can adequately support the
272	   requested services.  Steering decision may take into account more
273	   complex and possibly dynamic metric information, such as load of
274	   service instances, latency experienced or similar, for selection of a
275	   more suitable service instance.

277	   It is important to note that clients may move.  This means that the
278	   service instance that was "best" at one moment might no longer be
279	   best when a new service request is issued.  This creates a (physical)
280	   dynamicity that will need to be catered for in addition to the
281	   changes in server and network load.  From a routing perspective, CATS
282	   is an application-transparent routing mechanism that can provide
283	   scheduling for both stateful and stateless services.  However, in
284	   scenarios where clients move and the service is stateful, CATS
285	   requires the application to explicitly indicate whether it allows the
286	   routing system to enable CATS functionality.  Otherwise, mid-session
287	   scheduling triggered by CATS may cause application context
288	   inconsistency among service sites or even service interruption.

290	   Figure 1 shows a common way to deploy edge service sites in the
291	   metro.  Edge service sites are connected with Provider Edges(PEs).
292	   There is an edge data center for metro area which has high computing
293	   resource and provides the service to more User Equipments(UEs) (UE1
294	   to UEn) at the working time.  Because more office buildings are in
295	   the metro area.  And there are also some remote edge service sites
296	   which have limited computing resource and provide the service to the
297	   UEs (UEa, UEb) close to them.

299	   Applications to meet service demands could be deployed in both the
300	   edge data center in metro area and the remote edge service sites.  In
301	   this case, the service request and the resource are matched well.
302	   Some potential traffic steering may be needed just for special
303	   service request or some small scheduling demand.

325	             Figure 1: Common Deployment of Edge Service Sites

327	   Figure 2 shows that during non-working hours, for example at weekend
328	   or daily night, more UEs move to the remote area that are close to
329	   their house or for some weekend events.  So there will be more
330	   service request at remote but with limited computing resource, while
331	   the rich computing resource might not be used with less UE in the
332	   metro area.  It is possible for many people to request services at
333	   the remote area, but with the limited computing resource, moreover,
334	   as the people move from the metro area to the remote area, the edge
335	   service sites that serve common services will also change, so it may
336	   be necessary to steer some traffic back to the metro data center.

360	   There will also be the common variable of network and computing
361	   resources, for someone who is not moving but get a poor latency
362	   sometime.  Because of other UEs moving, a large number of request for
363	   temporary events such as vocal concert, shopping festival and so on,
364	   and there will also be the normal change of the network and computing
365	   resource status.  So for some fixed UEs, it is also expected to steer
366	   the traffic to appropriate sites dynamically.

368	   Those problems indicate that traffic needs to be steered among
369	   different edge service sites, because of the mobility of the UE and
370	   the common variable of network and computing resources.  Moreover,
371	   some use cases in the following section require both low latency and
372	   high computing resource usage or specific computing hardware
373	   capabilities (such as local GPU); hence joint optimization of network
374	   and computing resource is needed to guarantee the Quality of
375	   Experience (QoE).

377	4.  Use Cases

379	   This section presents a non-exhaustive set of use cases which would
380	   benefit from the dynamic selection of service instances and the
381	   steering of traffic to those service instances.

383	4.1.  Example 1: Computing-aware AR or VR

385	   Cloud VR/AR introduces the concept of cloud computing to the
386	   rendering of audiovisual assets in such applications.  Here, the edge
387	   cloud helps encode/decode and render content.  The end device usually
388	   only uploads posture or control information to the edge and then VR/
389	   AR contents are rendered in the edge cloud.  The video and audio
390	   outputs generated from the edge cloud are encoded, compressed, and
391	   transmitted back to the end device or further transmitted to central
392	   data center via high bandwidth networks.

394	   A Cloud VR service is delay-sensitive and influenced by both network
395	   and computing resources.  Therefore, the edge service site which
396	   executes the service has to be carefully selected to make sure it has
397	   sufficient computing resource and good network condition to guarantee
398	   the end-to-end service delay.  For example, for an entry-level cloud
399	   VR (panoramic 8K 2D video) with 110-degree Field of View (FOV)
400	   transmission, the typical network requirements are bandwidth 40Mbps,
401	   20ms for motion-to-photon latency, packet loss rate is 2.4E-5; the
402	   typical computing requirements are 8K H.265 real-time decoding, 2K
403	   H.264 real-time encoding.  Further, the 20ms latency can be
404	   categoried as:

406	   (i)    Sensor sampling delay(client), which is considered
407	          imperceptible by users is less than 1.5ms including an extra
408	          0.5ms for digitalization and end device processing.

410	   (ii)   Display refresh delay(client), which take 7.9ms based on the
411	          144Hz display refreshing rate and 1ms extra delay to light up.

413	   (iii)  Image/frame rendering delay(server), which could be reduced to
414	          5.5ms.

416	   (iv)   Round-trip network delay: The remaining latency budget is 5.1
417	          ms, calculated as 20-1.5-5.5-7.9 = 5.1ms.

419	   So the budgets for server(computing) delay and network delay are
420	   almost equivalent, which make sense to consider both of the delay for
421	   computing and network.  And it could't meet the total delay
422	   requirements or find the best choice by either optimizing the network
423	   or computing resource.

425	   Based on the analysis, here are some further assumption as Figure 3
426	   shows, the client could request any service instance among 3 edge
427	   service sites.  The delay of client could be same, and the
428	   differences of edge service sites and corresponding network path have
429	   different delays:

431	   *  Edge service site 1: The computing delay=4ms based on a light
432	      load, and the corresponding network delay=9ms based on a heavy
433	      traffic.

435	   *  Edge service site 2: The computing delay=10ms based on a heavy
436	      load, and the corresponding network delay=4ms based on a light
437	      traffic.

439	   *  Edge service site 3: The edge service site 3's computing delay=5ms
440	      based on a normal load, and the corresponding network delay=5ms
441	      based on a normal traffic.

443	   In this case, we can't get an optimal network and computing total
444	   delay if choosing the resource only based on either of computing or
445	   network status:

447	   *  The edge service site based on the best computing delay it will be
448	      the edge service site 1, the E2E delay=22.4ms.

450	   *  The edge service site based on the best network delay it will be
451	      the edge service site 2, the E2E delay=23.4ms.

453	   *  The edge service site based on both of the status it will be the
454	      edge site 3, the E2E delay=19.4ms.

456	   So, the best choice to ensure the E2E delay is edge service site 3,
457	   which is 19.4ms and is less than 20ms.  The differences of the E2E
458	   delay is only 3~4ms among the three, but some of them will meet the
459	   application demand while the others don't.

461	   The conclusion is that E2E delay is a key factor for traffic
462	   steering, and it is also necessary to consider whether an edge
463	   service site has the required GPU resources.  Even if a site offers
464	   good latency, it cannot provide the service if it lacks GPU support.
465	   For AR/VR scenarios, traffic should only be steered at the start of a
466	   service session, because mid-session steering involves significant
467	   context migration, which is costly and requires explicit application
468	   participation and approval.

500	   Furthermore, specific techniques may be employed to divide the
501	   overall rendering into base assets that are common across a number of
502	   clients participating in the service, while the client-specific input
503	   data is being utilized to render additional assets.  When being
504	   delivered to the client, those two assets are being combined into the
505	   overall content being consumed by the client.  The requirements for
506	   sending the client input data as well as the requests for the base
507	   assets may be different in terms of which service instances may serve
508	   the request, where base assets may be served from any nearby service
509	   instance (since those base assets may be served without requiring
510	   cross-request state being maintained), while the client-specific
511	   input data is being processed by a stateful service instance that
512	   changes, if at all, only slowly over time due to the stickiness of
513	   the service that is being created by the client-specific data.  Other
514	   splits of rendering and input tasks can be found in [TR22.874] for
515	   further reading.

517	   When it comes to the service instances themselves, those may be
518	   instantiated on-demand, e.g., driven by network or client demand
519	   metrics, while resources may also be released, e.g., after an idle
520	   timeout, to free up resources for other services.  Depending on the
521	   utilized node technologies, the lifetime of such "function as a
522	   service" may range from many minutes down to millisecond scale.
523	   Therefore, computing resources across participating edges exhibit a
524	   distributed (in terms of locations) as well as dynamic (in terms of
525	   resource availability) nature.  In order to achieve a satisfying
526	   service quality to end users, a service request will need to be sent
527	   to and served by an edge with sufficient computing resource and a
528	   good network path.

530	4.2.  Example 2: Computing-aware Intelligent Transportation

532	   Urban intelligent transportation relies on a large number of high-
533	   quality video capture devices, whose data needs to be processed at
534	   edge service sites (e.g., pedestrian flow statistics, vehicle
535	   tracking).  This imposes stringent requirements on the computing
536	   capabilities of edge service sites (for video processing) and network
537	   performance (bandwidth, latency).  CATS can address the issue by
538	   coordinating network and computing resources.

540	   In auxiliary driving scenarios (for example, "Extended Electronic
541	   Horizon" [HORITA]), edge service sites collect road and traffic data
542	   via V2X to address blind-spot and collision risks, and provide real-
543	   time warnings and maneuver guidance.  Requests are typically sent
544	   preferentially to the closest edge node.  However, if the closest
545	   node becomes overloaded, it may lead to response delays and safety
546	   risks, which requires CATS to perform traffic steering.

548	   Specifically, delay-insensitive services (e.g., in-vehicle
549	   entertainment) can be offloaded via CATS to edge service sites with
550	   lighter loads (even if they are farther away), while delay-sensitive
551	   assisted driving services are preferentially processed at local
552	   service sites.  As mentioned in the problem statement section, CATS
553	   is an application-transparent network-layer solution.  Unlike
554	   ALTO[RFC7285], it enables coordinated scheduling of network and
555	   computing resources without requiring application modifications.  For
556	   moving vehicles, CATS supports smooth and proactive context migration
557	   between edge nodes, provided that the application allows it, to
558	   maintain service continuity.  In addition, vehicle speed is a key
559	   factor: faster movement requires higher frequency of metric updates
560	   (to be detailed in the requirements section) to ensure that CATS
561	   steering decisions remain valid as vehicles switch services among
562	   base stations or edge service sites.

564	   In video recognition scenarios, traffic surges (e.g., during rush
565	   hours or weekends) can easily overload the closest edge service
566	   sites.  CATS addresses this scalability challenge by steering excess
567	   service requests to other appropriate sites, ensuring that processing
568	   capacity matches user demand.

570	4.3.  Example 3: Computing-aware Digital Twin

572	   A number of industry associations, such as the Industrial Digital
573	   Twin Association or the Digital Twin Consortium
574	   (https://www.digitaltwinconsortium.org/), have been founded to
575	   promote the concept of the Digital Twin (DT) for a number of use case
576	   areas, such as smart cities, transportation, industrial control,
577	   among others.  The core concept of the DT is the "administrative
578	   shell" [Industry4.0], which serves as a digital representation of the
579	   information and technical functionality pertaining to the "assets"
580	   (such as an industrial machinery, a transportation vehicle, an object
581	   in a smart city or others) that is intended to be managed,
582	   controlled, and actuated.

584	   As an example for industrial control, the programmable logic
585	   controller (PLC) may be virtualized and the functionality aggregated
586	   across a number of physical assets into a single administrative shell
587	   for the purpose of managing those assets.  PLCs may be virtualized in
588	   order to move the PLC capabilities from the physical assets to the
589	   edge cloud.  Several PLC instances may exist to enable load balancing
590	   and fail-over capabilities, while also enabling physical mobility of
591	   the asset and the connection to a suitable "nearby" PLC instance.
592	   With this, traffic dynamicity may be similar to that observed in the
593	   connected car scenario in the previous subsection.  Crucial here is
594	   high availability and bounded latency since a failure of the
595	   (overall) PLC functionality may lead to a production line stop, while
596	   boundary violations of the latency may lead to loosing
597	   synchronization with other processes and, ultimately, to production
598	   faults, tool failures or similar.

600	   Particular attention in Digital Twin scenarios is given to the
601	   problem of data storage.  Here, decentralization, not only driven by
602	   the scenario (such as outlined in the connected car scenario for
603	   cases of localized reasoning over data originating from driving
604	   vehicles) but also through proposed platform solutions, such as those
605	   in [GAIA-X], plays an important role.  With decentralization,
606	   endpoint relations between client and (storage) service instances may
607	   frequently change as a result.

609	   In this use case, CATS is required for selecting the optimal PLC
610	   instance and storage node, ensuring low latency and reliability for
611	   data processing in industrial scenarios, as well as low latency for
612	   data reading/writing during twin control processes.

614	4.4.  Example 4: Computing-aware SD-WAN

616	   SD-WAN is an overlay connectivity service that optimizes the
617	   transport of IP packets over one or more underlay connectivity
618	   services by recognizing applications and determining forwarding
619	   behavior through the application of policies [MEF70.2].  SD-WAN can
620	   be deployed by both service providers and enterprises to support
621	   connectivity across branch sites, data centers, and cloud
622	   environments.  Applications or services may be deployed at multiple
623	   locations to achieve performance, resiliency, or cost objectives.

625	   In current SD-WAN deployments, forwarding decisions are primarily
626	   based on network-related metrics such as available bandwidth,
627	   latency, packet loss, or path availability.  However, these decisions
628	   typically lack visibility into the computing resources available at
629	   the destination sites, such as CPU or GPU utilization, memory
630	   pressure, or other composite cost metrics.

632	   CATS metrics can complement existing SD-WAN network metrics by
633	   providing information about the availability and condition of
634	   computing resources associated with service instances at edge or
635	   cloud sites.  Such metrics may be consumed by a centralized SD-WAN
636	   controller when deriving policies or computing preferred paths, and/
637	   or by SD-WAN edge devices to make distributed, real-time traffic
638	   steering decisions among already-deployed service instances.  In both
639	   cases, the goal is to enable application traffic to be steered
640	   towards service instances and sites that best satisfy application
641	   requirements by jointly considering network and computing conditions.

643	   For the scenario of enterprises deploying applications in the cloud,
644	   SD-WAN provides enterprises with centralized control over Customer-
645	   Premises Equipments(CPEs) in branch offices and the cloudified
646	   CPEs(vCPEs) in the clouds.  The CPEs connect the clients in branch
647	   offices and the application servers in clouds.  The same application
648	   server in different clouds is called an application instance.
649	   Different application instances have different computing resource.

651	   SD-WAN is aware of the computing resource of applications deployed in
652	   the clouds by vCPEs, and selects the application instance for the
653	   client to visit according to computing power and the network state of
654	   WAN.

656	   Additionally, in order to provide cost-effective solutions, the SD-
657	   WAN may also consider cost, e.g., in terms of energy prices incurred
658	   or energy source used, when selecting a specific application instance
659	   over another.  For this, suitable metric information would need to be
660	   exposed, e.g., by the cloud provider, in terms of utilized energy or
661	   incurred energy costs per computing resource.

663	   Figure 4 below illustrates Computing-aware SD-WAN for Enterprise
664	   Cloudification.

680	   The current computing load status of the application APP1 in cloud1
681	   and cloud2 is as follows: each application uses 6 vCPUs.  The load of
682	   application in cloud1 is 50%. The load of application in cloud2 is
683	   20%. The computing resource of APP1 are collected by vCPE1 and vCPE2
684	   respectively.  Client1 and Client2 are visiting APP1 in cloud1.  WAN1
685	   and WAN2 have the same network states.  Considering lightly loaded
686	   application SD-WAN selects APP1 in cloud2 for the client3 in branch
687	   office.  The traffic of client3 follows the path: Client3 -> CPE ->
688	   WAN2 -> Cloud2 vCPE1 -> Cloud2 APP1

690	4.5.  Example 5: Computing-aware Distributed AI Training and Inference

692	   Artificial Intelligence (AI) large model refers to models that are
693	   characterized by their large size, high complexity, and high
694	   computational requirements.  AI large models have become increasingly
695	   important in various fields, such as natural language processing for
696	   text classification, computer vision for image classification and
697	   object detection, and speech recognition.

699	   AI large model contains two key phases: training and inference.
700	   Training refers to the process of developing an AI model by feeding
701	   it with large amounts of data and optimizing it to learn and improve
702	   its performance.  On the other hand, inference is the process of
703	   using the trained AI model to make predictions or decisions based on
704	   new input data.

706	4.5.1.  Distributed AI Inference

708	   With the fast development of AI large language models, more
709	   lightweight models can be deployed at edge service sites.  Figure 5
710	   shows the potential deployment of this case.

712	   AI inference contains two major steps, prefilling and decoding.
713	   Prefilling processes a user's prompt to generate the first token of
714	   the response in one step.  Following it, decoding sequentially
715	   generates subsequent tokens step-by-step until the termination token.
716	   These stages consume much computing resource.  Important metrics for
717	   AI inference are processor cores which transform prompts to tokens,
718	   and memory resources which are used to store key-values and cache
719	   tokens.  The generation and processing of tokens indicates the
720	   service capability of an AI inference system.  Single site deployment
721	   of the prefilling and decoding might not provide enough resources
722	   when there are many clients sending requests (prompts) to access AI
723	   inference service.

725	   More generally, we also see the use of cost information, specifically
726	   on the cost for energy expended on AI inferencing of the overall
727	   provided AI-based service, as a possible criteria for steering
728	   traffic.  Here, we envision (AI) service tiers being exposed to end
729	   users, allowing to prioritize, e.g., 'greener energy costs' as a key
730	   criteria for service fulfilment.  For this, the system would employ

754	4.5.2.  Distributed AI Training

756	   Although large language models are nowadays confined to be trained
757	   with very large centers with computational, often GPU-based,
758	   resources, platforms for federated or distributed training are being
759	   positioned, specifically when employing edge computing resources.

761	   While those approaches apply their own (collective) communication
762	   approach to steer the training and gradient data towards the various
763	   (often edge) computing sites, we also see a case for CATS traffic
764	   steering here.  For this, the training clusters themselves may be
765	   multi-site, i.e., combining resources from more than one site, but
766	   acting as service instances in a CATS sense, i.e., providing the
767	   respective training round as a service to the overall distributed/
768	   federated learning platform.

770	   One (cluster) site can be selected over another based on compute,
771	   network but also cost metrics, or a combination thereof.  For
772	   instance, training may be constrained based on the network resources
773	   to ensure timely delivery of the required training and gradient
774	   information to the cluster site, while also computational load may be
775	   considered, particularly when the cluster sites are multi-homed, thus
776	   hosting more than one application and therefore become (temporarily)
777	   overloaded.  But equally to our inferencing use case in the previous
778	   section, the overall training service may also be constrained by
779	   cost, specifically energy aspects, e.g., when positioning the service
780	   utilizing the trained model is advertising its 'green' credentials to
781	   the end users.  For this, costs based on energy pricing (over time)
782	   as well as the energy mix may be considered.  One could foresee, for
783	   instance, the coupling of surplus energy in renewable energy
784	   resources to a cost metric upon which traffic is steered preferably
785	   to those cluster sites that are merely consuming surplus and not grid
786	   energy.

788	   Storage is also necessary for performing distributed/federated
789	   learning due to several key reasons.  Firstly, it is needed to store
790	   model checkpoints produced throughout the training process, allowing
791	   for progress tracking and recovery in case of interruptions.
792	   Additionally, storage is used to keep samples of the dataset used to
793	   train the model, which often come from distributed sensors such as
794	   cameras, microphones, etc.  Furthermore, storage is required to hold
795	   the models themselves, which can be very large and complex.  Knowing
796	   the storage performance metrics is also important.  For instance,
797	   understanding the I/O transfer rate of the storage helps in
798	   determining the latency of accessing data from disk.  Additionally,
799	   knowing the size of the storage is relevant to understand how many
800	   model checkpoints can be stored or the maximum size of the model that
801	   can be locally stored.

803	4.6.  Discussion

805	   The five use cases mentioned in previous sections serve as examples
806	   to show that CATS are needed for traffic steering.  Considering that
807	   these use cases are enough to derive common requirements, this
808	   document only includes the aforementioned five use cases in the main
809	   body, although there have been more similar use cases proposed in
810	   CATS working group[I-D.dcn-cats-req-service-segmentation].  CATS has
811	   raised strong interests in many other standardization bodies, such as
812	   ETSI, 3GPP.  The applicability of CATS may be further extended in
813	   future use cases.  At the mean time, the CATS framework may also need
814	   to be modified or enhanced according to new requirements raised by
815	   potential new CATS use cases.  These potential use cases are not
816	   included in the current document main body, but are attached in the
817	   appendix A of this document.

819	5.  Requirements

821	   In the following, we outline the requirements for the CATS system to
822	   overcome the observed problems in the realization of the use cases
823	   above.

825	5.1.  Support Dynamic and Effective Selection among Multiple Service
826	      Instances

828	   The basic requirement of CATS is to support the dynamic access to
829	   different service instances residing in multiple computing sites and
830	   then being aware of their status, which is also the fundamental model
831	   to enable the traffic steering and to further optimize the network
832	   and computing services.  A unique CATS service identifier (CS-ID) is
833	   used by all the service instances for a specific service no matter
834	   which edge service site an instance may attach to.  The mapping of
835	   this CS-ID to a network locator is basic to steer traffic to any of
836	   the service instances deployed in various edge service sites.

838	   Moreover, according to CATS use cases, some applications require E2E
839	   low latency, which warrants a quick mapping of the service identifier
840	   to the network locator.  This leads to naturally the in-band methods,
841	   involving the consideration of using metrics that are oriented
842	   towards compute capabilities and resources, and their correlation
843	   with services.  Therefore, a desirable system

845	   R1: MUST provide a dynamic discovery and resolution method for
846	   mapping CS-ID to one or more current service instance addresses,
847	   based on up-to-date system state.

849	   R2: MUST provide a method to dynamically assess the availability of
850	   service instances, based on up-to-date status metrics (e.g., health,
851	   load, reachability).

853	   Note: The term "up-to-date" herein refers to the latest metric
854	   information collected by the system in accordance with the preset
855	   metric update cycle.  The principle for setting the cycle is
856	   generally pre-determined by the network.  For example, based on
857	   historical statistical data, a relatively appropriate update cycle
858	   (either second-level or millisecond-level) is selected for a specific
859	   type or certain types of services.

861	5.2.  Support Agreement on Metric Representation and Definition

863	   Computing metrics can have many different semantics, particularly for
864	   being service-specific.  Even the notion of a "computing load" metric
865	   could be represented in many different ways.  Such representation may
866	   entail information on the semantics of the metric or it may be purely
867	   one or more semantic-free numerals.  Agreement of the chosen
868	   representation among all service and network elements participating
869	   in the service instance selection decision is important.  Therefore,
870	   a desirable system
871	   R3: The implementations MUST agree on using metrics that are oriented
872	   towards compute capabilities and resources and their representation
873	   among service instances in the participating edges, at both design
874	   time and runtime.

876	   To better understand the meaning of different metrics and to better
877	   support appropriate use of metrics,

879	   R4: An information model of the compute and network resources MUST be
880	   defined.  Such a model MUST characterize how metrics are abstracted
881	   out from the compute and network resources.  We refer to this
882	   information model as the Resource Model.

884	   R5: The Resource Model MUST be implementable in an interoperable
885	   manner.  That is, metrics generated by this resource model MUST be
886	   understood and interoperable across independent CATS implementations.

888	   R6: The Resource Model MUST be executable in a scalable manner.  That
889	   is, the Resource Model MUST be capable of being executed at the
890	   required time scale and at an affordable cost (e.g., memory
891	   footprint, energy, etc.).

893	   We recognize that different network nodes, e.g., routers, switches,
894	   etc., may have diversified capabilities even in the same routing
895	   domain, let alone in different administrative domains and from
896	   different vendors.  Therefore, to work properly in a CATS system,

898	   R7: CATS systems MUST support staleness handling for CATS metrics and
899	   provide indications of when metrics should be refreshed, so that CATS
900	   components can know if a metric value is valid or not.

902	   R8: All metric information used in CATS MUST be produced and encoded
903	   in a format that is understood by participating CATS components.  For
904	   metrics that CATS components do not understand or support, CATS
905	   components will ignore them.

907	   R9: CATS MAY be applied in non-CATS network environments when needed,
908	   considering that CATS is designed with extensibility and could work
909	   compatibly with existing non-CATS network environments when the
910	   network components in these environments could be upgraded to know
911	   the meaning of CATS metrics.

913	   R10: CATS components SHOULD support a mechanism to advertise or
914	   negotiate supported metric types and encodings to ensure
915	   compatibility across implementations.

917	   R11: The computation and use of metrics in CATS MUST be designed to
918	   avoid introducing routing loops or path oscillations when metrics are
919	   distributed and used for path selection.

921	   Compute metrics can change rapidly, which may lead to path
922	   oscillation if metrics are updated too frequently or become stale if
923	   updated too infrequently.  R10 ensures that CATS components can
924	   negotiate metric types for consistent interpretation, while R11
925	   requires that metrics be used in a way that avoids routing loops and
926	   path instability.  Together, they balance responsiveness with
927	   stability.

929	5.3.  Use of CATS Metrics

931	   Network path costs in the current routing system usually do not
932	   change very frequently.  Network traffic engineering metrics (such as
933	   available bandwidth) may change more frequently as traffic demands
934	   fluctuate, but distribution of these changes is normally damped so
935	   that only significant changes cause routing protocol messages.

937	   However, metrics that are oriented towards compute capabilities and
938	   resources in general can be highly dynamic, e.g., changing rapidly
939	   with the number of sessions, the CPU/GPU utilization and the memory
940	   consumption, etc.  Service providers must determine at what interval
941	   or based on what events such information needs to be distributed.
942	   Overly frequent distribution with more accurate synchronization may
943	   result in unnecessary overhead in terms of signaling.

945	   Moreover, depending on the service related decision logic, one or
946	   more metrics need to be conveyed in a CATS domain.  The problem to be
947	   addressed here may be the frequency of such conveyance, and which
948	   CATS component is the decision maker for the service instance
949	   selection should also be considered.  Thereby, choosing appropriate
950	   protocols for conveying CATS metrics is important.  While existing
951	   routing protocols may serve as a baseline for signaling metrics, for
952	   example, BGP extensions[RFC4760] and GRASP[RFC8990].  These routing
953	   protocols may be more suitable for distributed systems.  Considering
954	   about some centralized approaches to select CATS service instances,
955	   other means to convey the metrics can equally be chosen and even be
956	   realized, for example, leveraging restful API for publication of CATS
957	   metrics to a centralized decision maker.  Specifically, a desirable
958	   system,

960	   R12: MUST provide mechanisms for metric collection, including
961	   specifying the responsible entity for collection.

963	   Collecting metrics from all of the services instances may incur much
964	   overhead for decision makers.  Hierarchical aggregation helps reduce
965	   this burden by consolidating metrics at intermediate nodes, providing
966	   a more scalable and efficient view of resource conditions.

968	   CATS components do not need to be aware of how metrics are collected
969	   behind the aggregator.  The decision point may not be directly
970	   connected with service instances or metric collectors, therefore,

972	   R13: MUST provide mechanisms to distribute the metrics.

974	   There may be various update frequencies for different computing
975	   metrics.  Some of the metrics may be more dynamic, while others are
976	   relatively static.  Accordingly, different distribution methods may
977	   need to be chosen with respect to different update frequencies of
978	   different metrics.  Therefore a system,

980	   For example, In highly mobile scenarios, such as fast-moving vehicles
981	   mentioned in Section 4.2, compute metrics can quickly become outdated
982	   as the UE moves across base stations and edge service sites,
983	   potentially requiring more frequent updates.  However, updates should
984	   remain stable and avoid excessive overhead.

986	   R14: MUST NOT be sensitive to the update frequency of the metrics,
987	   and MUST NOT be dependent on or vulnerable to the mechanisms used to
988	   distribute the metrics.

990	5.4.  Support Instance Affinity

992	   In the CATS system, a service may be provided by one or more service
993	   instances that would be deployed at different locations in the
994	   network.  Each instance provides equivalent service functionality to
995	   its respective clients.  The decision logic of the instance selection
996	   is subject to the packet level communication and packets are
997	   forwarded based on the operating status of both network and computing
998	   resources.  This resource status will likely change over time,
999	   leading to individual packets potentially being sent to different
1000	   network locations, possibly segmenting individual service
1001	   transactions and breaking service-level semantics.  Moreover, when a
1002	   client moves, the access point might change and successively lead to
1003	   the migration of service instances.  If execution changes from one
1004	   (e.g., virtualized) service instance to another, state/context needs
1005	   to be transferred to the new instance.  Such required transfer of
1006	   state/context makes it desirable to have instance affinity as the
1007	   default, removing the need for explicit context transfer, while also
1008	   supporting an explicit state/context transfer (e.g., when metrics
1009	   change significantly).

1011	   The nature of this affinity is highly dependent on the nature of the
1012	   service, which could be seen as an 'instance affinity' to represent
1013	   the relationship.  The minimal affinity of a single request
1014	   represents a stateless service, where each service request may be
1015	   responded to without any state being held at the service instance for
1016	   fulfilling the request.

1018	   Providing any necessary information/state in the manner of in-band as
1019	   part of the service request, e.g., in the form of a multi-form body
1020	   in an HTTP request or through the URL provided as part of the
1021	   request, is one way to achieve such stateless nature.

1023	   Alternatively, the affinity to a particular service instance may span
1024	   more than one request, as in the AR/VR use case, where the previous
1025	   client input is needed to render subsequent frames.

1027	   However, a client, e.g., a mobile UE, may have many applications
1028	   running.  If all, or majority, of the applications request the CATS-
1029	   based services, then the runtime states that need to be created and
1030	   accordingly maintained would require high granularity.  In the
1031	   extreme scenario, this granular requirement could reach the level of
1032	   per-UE, per-APP, and per-(sub)flow with regard to a service instance.
1033	   Evidently, these fine-granular runtime states can potentially place a
1034	   heavy burden on network devices if they have to dynamically create
1035	   and maintain them.  On the other hand, it is not appropriate either
1036	   to place the state-keeping task on clients themselves.

1038	   Besides, there might be the case that UE moves to a new (access)
1039	   network or the service instance is migrated to another cloud, which
1040	   cause the unreachable or inconvenient of the original service
1041	   instance.  So the UE and service instance mobility also need to be
1042	   considered.

1044	   Therefore, a desirable system,

1046	   R15: CATS systems MUST maintain instance affinity for stateful
1047	   sessions and transactions on a per-flow basis.

1049	   R16: MUST avoid maintaining per-flow states for specific applications
1050	   in network nodes for providing instance affinity.

1052	   R17: SHOULD support service continuity in the presence of UE or
1053	   service instance mobility.

1055	5.5.  Preserve Communication Confidentiality

1057	   Exposing CATS metrics to the network may lead to the leakage of
1058	   application privacy.  In order to prevent it, it is necessary to
1059	   consider the methods to handle the sensitive information.  For
1060	   instance, using general anonymization methods, including hiding the
1061	   key information representing the identification of devices, or using
1062	   an index to represent the service level of computing resources, or
1063	   using customized information exposure strategies according to
1064	   specific application requirements or network scheduling requirements.
1065	   At the same time, when anonymity is achieved, it is important to
1066	   ensure that the exposed computing information remains sufficient to
1067	   enable effective traffic steering.  Therefore, a CATS system

1069	   R18: MUST preserve the confidentiality of the communication relation
1070	   between a user and a service provider by minimizing the exposure of
1071	   user-relevant information according to user's demands.

1073	5.6.  Correlation between Use Cases and Requirements

1075	   A table is presented in this section to better illustrate the
1076	   correlation between CATS use cases and requirements, 'X' is for
1077	   marking that the requirement can be derived from the corresponding
1078	   use case.

1123	         Figure 6: Mapping between CATS Use Cases and Requirements

1125	6.  Security Considerations

1127	   CATS decision-making relies on real-time computing and network status
1128	   as well as service information, requiring robust security safeguards
1129	   to mitigate risks associated with dynamic service and resource
1130	   scheduling, and cross-node data transmission.

1132	   Core Security Risks and Requirements include:

1134	   * User Privacy Leakage Risk

1136	   Description: CATS involves user-related data (e.g., access patterns,
1137	   service requests) across edge service sites.  Unauthorized disclosure
1138	   of user identifiers or per-user behavior tracking risks profiling or
1139	   identity theft, especially in use cases with personal/context-rich
1140	   data (e.g., AR/VR, vehicle trajectories, AI prompts), violating
1141	   regulations and eroding trust.

1143	   R19: User activity privacy MUST be preserved by anonymizing
1144	   identifying information.  Per-user behavior pattern tracking is
1145	   prohibited.

1147	   * Service Instance Identity Spoofing and Traffic Hijacking

1149	   Description: Attackers may spoof legitimate service instance
1150	   identities or tamper with "CS-ID-instance address" mappings (per R1),
1151	   diverting traffic to malicious nodes.  This undermines CATS' core
1152	   scheduling logic, causing service disruptions, data leaks, and
1153	   potential physical harm in safety-critical scenarios.

1155	   R20: Service instances MUST be authenticated.  "CS-ID - instance
1156	   address" mapping results MUST be encrypted.

1158	   * Tampering and False Reporting of CATS Metrics

1160	   Description: Attackers may tamper with core scheduling metrics or
1161	   submit false data (per R3-R17), misleading traffic steering
1162	   decisions.  This leads to node overload, link congestion, or
1163	   "resource exhaustion attacks," directly degrading Quality of
1164	   Experience (QoE).

1166	   R21: Metric collection and distribution MUST employ encryption.
1167	   Mechanisms for secondary validation and traceability of abnormal
1168	   metrics MUST be supported, avoiding over-reliance on single-node
1169	   reports.

1171	   * Security of Cross-Node Context Migration Data
1172	   Description: During user or terminal mobility, session states and
1173	   computing context (e.g., AR rendering progress, vehicle status) may
1174	   be intercepted or tampered with during cross-node migration (per
1175	   R18-R22).  This impairs service continuity, leaks sensitive data, or
1176	   causes state inconsistency.

1178	   R22: Migration data MUST use end-to-end encryption, accessible only
1179	   to authorized target instances.  Migration instructions MUST include
1180	   integrity check codes.

1255	Appendix A.  Appendix A

1257	   This section presents an additional CATS use case, which is not
1258	   included in the main body of this document.  Reasons are that the use
1259	   case may bring new requirements that are not considered in the
1260	   initail charter of CATS working group.  The requirements impact the
1261	   design of CATS framework and may need further modificaition or
1262	   enhancement on the initial CATS framework that serves all the
1263	   existing use cases listed in the main body.  However, the ISAC use
1264	   case is promising and has gained industry consensus.  Therefore, this
1265	   use case may be considered in future work of CATS working group.

1267	A.1.  Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC)

1269	   Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) enables wireless
1270	   networks to perform simultaneous data transmission and environmental
1271	   sensing.  In a distributed sensing scenario, multiple network nodes
1272	   --such as base stations, access points, or edge devices-- collect raw
1273	   sensing data from the environment.  This data can include radio
1274	   frequency (RF) reflections, Doppler shifts, channel state information
1275	   (CSI), or other physical-layer features that provide insights into
1276	   object movement, material composition, or environmental conditions.
1277	   To extract meaningful information, the collected raw data must be
1278	   aggregated and processed by a designated computing node with
1279	   sufficient computational resources.  This requires efficient
1280	   coordination between sensing nodes and computing resources to ensure
1281	   timely and accurate analysis, making it a relevant use case for
1282	   Computing-Aware Traffic Steering (CATS) in IETF.

1284	   This use case aligns with ongoing efforts in standardization bodies
1285	   such as the ETSI ISAC Industry Specification Group (ISG),
1286	   particularly Work Item #5 (WI#5), titled 'Integration of Computing
1287	   with ISAC'.  WI#5 focuses on exploring different forms of computing
1288	   integration within ISAC systems, including sensing combined with
1289	   computing, communications combined with computing, and the holistic
1290	   integration of ISAC with computing.  The considerations outlined in
1291	   this document complement ETSI's work by examining how computing-aware
1292	   networking solutions, as developed within CATS, can optimize the
1293	   processing and routing of ISAC sensing data.

1295	   As an example, we can consider a network domain with multiple sites
1296	   capable of hosting the ISAC computing "service", each with
1297	   potentially different connectivity and computing characteristics.
1298	   Figure 7 shows an exemplary scenario.  Considering the connectivity
1299	   and computing latencies (just as an example of metrics), the best
1300	   service site is #n-1 in the example used in the Figure.  Note that in
1301	   the figure we stilluse the old terminology in which by ICR we mean
1302	   Ingress CATS-Forwarder [I-D.ietf-cats-framework], and by ECR we mean
1303	   Egress CATS-Forwarder.

1345	                     Figure 7: Exemplary ISAC Scenario

1347	   In the distributed sensing use case, the sensed data collected by
1348	   multiple nodes must be efficiently routed to a computing node capable
1349	   of processing it.  The choice of the computing node depends on
1350	   several factors, including computational load, network congestion,
1351	   and latency constraints.  CATS mechanisms can optimize the selection
1352	   of the processing node by dynamically steering the traffic based on
1353	   computing resource availability and network conditions.
1354	   Additionally, as sensing data is often time-sensitive, CATS can
1355	   ensure low-latency paths while balancing computational demands across
1356	   different processing entities.  This capability is essential for
1357	   real-time applications such as cooperative perception for autonomous
1358	   systems, industrial monitoring, and smart city infrastructure.

1360	A.1.1.  Requirements

1362	   In addition to some of the requirements already identified for CATS
1363	   in the main body of this document, there are several additional
1364	   challenges and requirements that need to be addressed for efficient
1365	   distributed sensing in ISAC-enabled networks:

1367	   CATS systems should be able to select an instance where multiple
1368	   nodes can steer traffic to simultaneously, ensuring that packets
1369	   arrive within a maximum time period.  This is required because there
1370	   are distributed tasks in which there are multiple nodes acting as
1371	   sensors that produce sensing data that has to be then processed by a
1372	   sensing processing function, typically hosted at the edge.  This
1373	   implies that there is a multi-point to point kind of direction of the
1374	   traffic, with connectivity and computing requirements associated
1375	   (which can be very strict for some types of sensing schema).

1377	   CATS systems should provide mechanisms that implement per node/flow
1378	   security and privacy policies to adapt to the nature of the sensitive
1379	   information that might be exchanged in a sensing task.
