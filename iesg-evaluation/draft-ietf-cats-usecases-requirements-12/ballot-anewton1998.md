## Comments

Thanks for this document and the work that went into it.

### Applicability to all networks

907	   R9: CATS MAY be applied in non-CATS network environments when needed,
908	   considering that CATS is designed with extensibility and could work
909	   compatibly with existing non-CATS network environments when the
910	   network components in these environments could be upgraded to know
911	   the meaning of CATS metrics.

Is the intent of this requirement to allow a CATS solution to be applicable
outside of CATS environments? In other words, a solution can be considered a
CATS solution even if it useful in non-CATS environments? Or is it only a
CATS solution if it is applicable to a non-CATS environment that will be
upgraded to a CATS environment? If it is the former, do you think a clarification
is necessary?

Thanks.
