11	Abstract

13	   This document retires the use of ECC-GOST within DNSSEC.

15	   RFC5933 (now historic) defined the use of GOST R 34.10-2001 and GOST
16	   R 34.11-94 algorithms with DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC).  This
17	   document updates RFC5933 by deprecating the use of ECC-GOST.

19	   [RFC Editor: please remove this before publication: It is unclear if
20	   updating RFC5933 (a Historic document) is the correct thing to do or
21	   not.  We did it so that it shows up in Datatracker and similar, but
22	   this may be a mistake.  We are happy to change this if the RFC Editor
23	   / IESG / whoever thinks this is a bad idea.]

72	1.  Introduction

74	   The use of the GOST R 34.10-2001 and GOST R 34.11-94 algorithms with
75	   the DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) [RFC9364] was documented in
76	   [RFC5933].  These two algorithms were deprecated by the Orders of the
77	   Federal Agency for Technical Regulation and Metrology of Russia
78	   (Rosstandart) in August 2012, and were superseded by GOST 34.10-2012
79	   and GOST 34.11-2012 respectively.  The use of GOST 34.10-2012 and
80	   GOST 34.11-2012 in DNSSEC is documented in [RFC9558], and so
81	   [RFC5933] has been made Historic.

83	   Thus, the use of GOST R 34.10-2001 (mnemonic GOST-ECC) and and GOST R
84	   34.11-94 is no longer recommended for use in DNSSEC [RFC9364].

86	   Note that this document does not change or discuss the use of GOST
87	   34.10-2012 and GOST 34.11-2012.

89	1.1.  Requirements notation

91	   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
92	   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
93	   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
94	   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
95	   capitals, as shown here.

97	2.  Deprecating ECC-GOST algorithms in DNSSEC

99	   The GOST R 34.11-94 [RFC5933] algorithm MUST NOT be used when
100	   creating DS records.  Validating resolvers MUST treat GOST R 34.11-94
101	   DS records as insecure.  If no other DS records of accepted
102	   cryptographic algorithms are available, the DNS records below the
103	   delegation point MUST be treated as insecure.

105	   The ECC-GOST [RFC5933] algorithm MUST NOT be used when creating
106	   DNSKEY and RRSIG records.  Validating resolvers MUST treat RRSIG
107	   records created from DNSKEY records using these algorithms as an
108	   unsupported algorithm.  If no other RRSIG records of accepted
109	   cryptographic algorithms are available, the validating resolver MUST
110	   consider the associated resource records as insecure.

112	3.  Security Considerations

114	   This document potentially increases the security of the DNSSEC
115	   ecosystem by deprecating algorithms that are no longer recommended
116	   for use.

118	4.  Operational Considerations

120	   This document removes support for ECC-GOST.  Zone operators currently
121	   making use of ECC-GOST based algorithms should switch to algorithms
122	   that remain supported.  DNS registries should prohibit their clients
123	   from uploading and publishing ECC-GOST based DS records to ensure
124	   that they are using algorithms which are supported by DNSSEC
125	   validators, and so can be DNSSEC validated.

127	5.  IANA Considerations

129	   IANA is requested to set the "Use for DNSSEC Signing", "Use for
130	   DNSSEC Validation", "Implement for DNSSEC Signing", and "Implement
131	   for DNSSEC Validation" columns of the DNS Security Algorithm Numbers
132	   registry [DNSKEY-IANA] for ECC-GOST (12) to MUST NOT.  Note that
133	   previously the "Use for DNSSEC Signing" and "Implement for DNSSEC
134	   Delegation" columns were already MUST NOT.

136	   IANA is requested to set the "Use for DNSSEC Delegation", "Use for
137	   DNSSEC Validation", "Implement for DNSSEC Delegation", and "Implement
138	   for DNSSEC Validation" columns of the "Digest Algorithms" registry
139	   [DS-IANA] for GOST R 34.11-94 (3) to MUST NOT.  Note that previously
140	   the "Use for DNSSEC Signing" and "Implement for DNSSEC Delegation"
141	   columns were already MUST NOT.
