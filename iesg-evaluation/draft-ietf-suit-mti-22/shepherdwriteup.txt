Working Group Summary:

There is consensus for this document in the SUIT WG.

Document Quality:

Projects at the IETF Hackathon have informed this document.

Personnel:

Russ Housley is the document shepherd.
Deb Cooley is the responsible area director.


(3) Briefly describe the review of this document that was performed by
the Document Shepherd.  If this version of the document is not ready for
publication, please explain why the document is being forwarded to the
IESG.

The document shepherd did a thorough review of the document during
WG Last Call.  All issues that were raised during WG Last Call have
been resolved.


(4) Does the document Shepherd have any concerns about the depth or
breadth of the reviews that have been performed?

No concerns.


(5) Do portions of the document need review from a particular or from
broader perspective, e.g., security, operational complexity, AAA, DNS,
DHCP, XML, or internationalization?  If so, describe the review that took
place.

No concerns.


(6) Describe any specific concerns or issues that the Document Shepherd
has with this document that the Responsible Area Director and/or the IESG
should be aware of?  For example, perhaps he or she is uncomfortable with
certain parts of the document, or has concerns whether there really is a
need for it.  In any event, if the WG has discussed those issues and has
indicated that it still wishes to advance the document, detail those
concerns here.

No concerns.


(7) Has each author confirmed that any and all appropriate IPR
disclosures required for full conformance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/bcp78/">BCP 78</a>
and <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a> have already been filed.  If not, explain why?

The authors have explicitly stated that all known IPR has been
disclosed.


(8) Has an IPR disclosure been filed that references this document?  If
so, summarize any WG discussion and conclusion regarding the IPR
disclosures.

No IPR disclosures have been filed.


(9) How solid is the WG consensus behind this document?  Does it
represent the strong concurrence of a few individuals, with others being
silent, or does the WG as a whole understand and agree with it?

There is consensus for this document in the SUIT WG.


(10) Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme
discontent?  If so, please summarise the areas of conflict in separate
email messages to the Responsible Area Director.  (It should be in a
separate email because this questionnaire is publicly available.)

No one has threatened an appeal.


(11) Identify any ID nits the Document Shepherd has found in this
document.  (See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/">http://www.ietf.org/tools/idnits/</a> and the Internet-Drafts
Checklist).  Boilerplate checks are not enough; this check needs to be
thorough.

IDnits gets really confused processing the CCDL in Appendix A.  It
seems to think thet things in square brackets are missing references.


(12) Describe how the document meets any required formal review criteria,
such as the MIB Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.

No special reviews are needed.  CBOR experts have looked at
Appendix A.


(13) Have all references within this document been identified as either
normative or informative?

Yes.


(14) Are there normative references to documents that are not ready for
advancement or are otherwise in an unclear state?  If such normative
references exist, what is the plan for their completion?

No.


(15) Are there downward normative references references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>)?
If so, list these downward references to support the Area Director in the
Last Call procedure.

There are no downward normative references.


(16) Will publication of this document change the status of any existing
RFCs?  Are those RFCs listed on the title page header, listed in the
abstract, and discussed in the introduction?  If the RFCs are not listed
in the Abstract and Introduction, explain why, and point to the part of
the document where the relationship of this document to the other RFCs is
discussed.  If this information is not in the document, explain why the
WG considers it unnecessary.

No.


(17) Describe the Document Shepherd's review of the IANA considerations
section, especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the
document.  Confirm that all protocol extensions that the document makes
are associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries.
Confirm that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified.
Confirm that newly created IANA registries include a detailed
specification of the initial contents for the registry, that allocations
procedures for future registrations are defined, and a reasonable name
for the new registry has been suggested (see <a href="/doc/rfc5226/">RFC 5226</a>).

Section 6 describes a new registry to be created by IANA.


(18) List any new IANA registries that require Expert Review for future
allocations.  Provide any public guidance that the IESG would find useful
in selecting the IANA Experts for these new registries.

No Expert Review registries are talked about in this document.


(19) Describe reviews and automated checks performed by the Document
Shepherd to validate sections of the document written in a formal
language, such as XML code, BNF rules, MIB definitions, etc.

None are needed.
