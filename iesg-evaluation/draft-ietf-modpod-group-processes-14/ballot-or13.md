## Comments

### Reinstatement appeals

```
418	   To avoid denial-of-service attacks on our processes, decisions to not
419	   reinstate someone's participation privileges may not be appealed.
420	   Any reinstatement is a grace and not a right.
```

I understand this logic, but wonder if 1 appeal per year would be a true denial of service. 
Seems like exponential back off might be better than the elimination of the appeal path.

The IESG and IAB may lose some signal (from the subjects of moderation, in constrast to the moderation team) on how moderation practices are evolving over time, and such signal might inform the selection of the moderator team.

## Nits

### Could be clearer / reads awkwardly

```
434	   report suspected harassment.  They should nonetheless take any
435	   necessary actions regarding disruptive behavior.
```
