12	Abstract

14	   The IETF community will treat people with kindness and grace, but not
15	   endless patience.

17	   This memo obsoletes RFCs 3683 and 3934, and it updates RFCs 2418 and
18	   9245 establishing a policy for the moderation of disruptive
19	   participation across the IETF's various public contribution channels
20	   and discussion fora.  It establishes guardrails for moderation and a
21	   moderator team.  That team will develop a set of guidelines and
22	   facilitate their consistent implementation with chairs and
23	   administrators.

118	1.  Introduction

120	   This memo establishes a policy for the moderation of disruptive
121	   participation across the IETF's various public contribution channels
122	   and discussion fora.  It creates a moderator team to develop
123	   procedures and to facilitate their consistent application.

125	   This memo obsoletes and updates some prior IETF processes, summarized
126	   here.  Background information is described in more detail in
127	   Appendix B.

129	   This memo makes the following changes to existing processes:

131	   *  Obsoletes [RFC3683] as the "posting rights" (PR) action it defines
132	      are replaced by processes defined herein;

134	   *  Obsoletes [RFC3934] as it replaces working group moderation
135	      procedures;

137	   *  Obsoletes Section 3 of [RFC9245] and the second paragraph of
138	      Section 4 of [RFC9245], as the moderator team replaces the IETF
139	      discussion list moderation team.

141	   *  Updates Section 6.1 of [RFC2418], because the moderator team will
142	      now work together with working group chairs to moderate disruptive
143	      behavior.

145	   The processes described in this memo are solely applicable to IETF
146	   activities, and not to other related organizations, such as the
147	   Internet Research Task Force (IRTF), the Internet Architecture Board
148	   (IAB), the RFC Series Working Group (RSWG), the RFC Series Approval
149	   Board (RSAB), or the Independent RFC Submission Stream, without their
150	   explicit agreement.  These changes take effect when the procedures
151	   described in Section 4 have been approved by the IESG.

153	1.1.  Terminology Note

155	   Below we use the term "administrator" to refer to the people who are
156	   assigned by the IESG to manage a particular public participation
157	   channel or discussion forum.  This memo uses the term "forum" to
158	   refer to any public IETF participation channel, such as a mailing
159	   list, chat group, or discussion in a collaborative tool such as
160	   GitHub or GitLab.  For example, working group chairs are
161	   administrators of all the public fora their WG uses, which typically
162	   includes mailing lists and chat groups, but might also include
163	   collaborative tools such as GitHub or GitLab.  Another example of
164	   administrators are the "owners" of non-WG IETF mailing lists.

166	1.2.  General Philosophy

168	   The cornerstone of our philosophy is that individuals are responsible
169	   for furthering the goals of the IETF as an organization [RFC3935] in
170	   a manner consistent with the policy laid out in [RFC7154].

172	   Disagreement and diverse points of view within any standards
173	   organization are to be expected, and are even healthy.  The IETF is
174	   an open standards organization with a discussion-based rough
175	   consensus process, a non-normative description of which is in
176	   [RFC7282].  Engaged, respectful discussion that is within the scope
177	   of an IETF forum should therefore not be considered disruptive, nor
178	   should someone be considered disruptive solely because they are
179	   outside the rough consensus.  However, when someone crosses the line
180	   into disruptive behavior, some action must be taken in order to
181	   maintain decorum of the community.

183	   The moderation policy goals are as follows:

185	   *  Apply consistent, fair, and timely moderation of communication
186	      across all public IETF participation channels and participation
187	      fora without regard to a participant's role in the IETF or
188	      previous technical contributions;

190	   *  Appeals are available to address disagreements about moderation
191	      actions;

193	   *  Balance transparency against both privacy of individuals involved
194	      and further disruption to the community;

196	   *  Allow moderation decisions to be reconsidered; and

198	   *  Provide the broadest possible latitude to all people doing
199	      moderation, so that they have the flexibility to address a broad
200	      range of individuals and circumstances.

202	   Questions about processes detailed below should be answered through
203	   the lens of these aims.

205	   The goal is explicitly *not* punishment, but to maintain an open,
206	   welcoming, non-hostile environment in which all may participate on an
207	   equal footing, regardless of their role in the IETF or past technical
208	   contributions.

210	2.  IETF Moderator Team

212	   This memo proposes a consistent approach to moderating the IETF's
213	   various public fora.  A moderator team for the IETF will develop
214	   guidelines for moderation and will facilitate their consistent
215	   implementation and application as detailed below.  These changes are
216	   intended to address the issues identified in the previous model
217	   Appendix B.2 and the principles described in the introduction.

219	2.1.  Composition

221	   The IESG appoints and recalls moderators.  The moderator team
222	   initially consists of no fewer than five individuals.  The moderator
223	   team may expand or contract based on operational experience.  In
224	   selecting members, the IESG will take into account geographic
225	   coverage, expected and unexpected absences, and team diversity.

227	   Because the IESG and IAB are in the appeals chain for moderator team
228	   decisions (see Section 4.1), the IESG must not appoint a moderator
229	   who is serving on the IESG or IAB.  Individuals serving on other
230	   bodies to which the NomCom appoints members, such as the IETF Trust
231	   or the LLC Board, as well as LLC staff and contractors shall also be
232	   excluded from serving on the moderator team.  If a moderator is
233	   assuming any such role, they shall step down from the moderator team
234	   soon after.

236	2.1.1.  Team Diversity

238	   Due to the global nature of the IETF, the membership of this team
239	   should reflect a diversity of time zones and other participant
240	   characteristics that lets it operate effectively around the clock and
241	   throughout the year.  Ideally, the moderators should be able to
242	   respond to issues within a few hours.

244	   Team diversity is also important to ensure any participant observing
245	   disruptive behavior can identify a moderator they feel comfortable
246	   contacting.

248	2.2.  Training

250	   The IETF is committed to providing and/or funding training for
251	   administrators and moderators as necessary.  The IESG will negotiate
252	   any required funding or resources with IETF Administration LLC
253	   [RFC8711].

255	3.  Scope and Responsibilities

257	   This policy applies to all public IETF fora, both present and future,
258	   including, but not limited to, mailing lists, chat groups, and
259	   discussions in other systems that the IETF or WGs have chosen to
260	   employ, such as GitHub repositories, wikis, or issue trackers.

262	   Different people have different moderation responsibilities:

264	   *  *Participants* should always behave in a manner discussed in
265	      Section 1.2.  They are also encouraged to report disruptive
266	      behavior directed at them or someone else to an administrator of
267	      the respective forum *and* the moderators.

269	   *  *Administrators* are primarily responsible for managing their fora
270	      in accordance with guidance developed by the moderators and
271	      approved by the IESG.  As such, they shall address reports of
272	      disruptive behavior in a timely fashion, apprising moderators of
273	      reports or actions taken.  Administrators may amend or rescind
274	      actions, including those taken by members of the moderation team
275	      *after* they have consulted with that team.

277	      For a working group, chairs are by default the administrators.
278	      They may delegate this responsibility in the same vein as
279	      Section 6.4 of [RFC2418] but they must always accept, acknowledge,
280	      and keep track of complaints of disruptive behavior.  Forum
281	      administrators should perform moderation in a way that obviates
282	      the need for moderator team involvement.

284	   *  *Moderators* are responsible for establishing procedures to
285	      address moderation needs across all IETF fora, both present and
286	      future.  They are a resource that the community can use to address
287	      disruptive behavior.  The moderator team is responsible to the
288	      IESG.  The IESG will create or designate a forum to facilitate
289	      discussion about moderation, and refer interested parties to that
290	      forum.

292	      Moderators may take actions when administrators do not respond to
293	      reports in a timely fashion.  Their first action should generally
294	      be to attempt to contact and advise the relevant administrators.
295	      They should only take moderation actions when administrators are
296	      not responsive, or when someone disrupts multiple fora at the same
297	      time.  Moderators should generally give WG chairs the opportunity
298	      to manage what may be difficult and contentious debates within
299	      their groups.  Within the bounds of this principle, it is left to
300	      moderators' judgement to determine when they must act, with the
301	      understanding that some situations may require fast responses.
302	      Section 4.1 discusses the handling of disagreements.

304	      Moderators are administrators for IETF plenary fora, currently
305	      including the IETF discussion and last-call lists and any plenary
306	      chat sessions.  They are also administrators for any forum that
307	      does not otherwise have an administrator.

309	      In order to scale the function, except for plenary fora as
310	      described above, moderators are not expected to always actively
311	      monitor all communications.  In general, they will process reports
312	      from participants.

314	   *  *Area Directors* are expected to resolve conflicts as described
315	      here and in Section 4.1.  The IESG will periodically evaluate the
316	      performance and needs of moderators, and may appoint and recall
317	      moderators as they deem appropriate.  Apart from that, the IESG
318	      shall refrain from the day-to-day operation and management of the
319	      moderator team.  The moderators may consult with the IESG when
320	      needed.

322	3.1.  Actions That Are Out of Scope

324	   Moderator actions are only permitted for the purposes of limiting
325	   disruptive communications in IETF fora.  All other actions are beyond
326	   the scope of this memo.  Examples of actions that are out of scope
327	   include, but are not limited to, Datatracker account removal,
328	   restriction of in-person meeting registration, content removal or
329	   redaction, and moderation or policing of private or non-IETF
330	   communications.  While the moderator team does not moderate non-
331	   public IETF mailing lists, the administrators of such lists can
332	   choose to adopt some of the procedures that the moderator team
333	   develops.

335	3.2.  Unsolicited Bulk Messages

337	   Unsolicited bulk messages are considered disruptive and should be
338	   handled in a manner consistent with the IESG statement on IETF Spam
339	   Control on IETF Mailing Lists[IESG-SPAM], or its successors.
340	   Administrators and moderators may take similar actions in other fora
341	   (e.g., GitHub or Instant Messaging).  Such actions require no
342	   additional reporting.

344	4.  Moderation Procedures and Transparency

346	   Within the bounds of the policies set herein, the moderator team
347	   shall develop and maintain procedures and criteria relating to
348	   moderation, including the moderator team's own operating procedures.

350	   Those procedures and criteria shall be developed with community
351	   input, be approved by the IESG prior to going into effect, and be
352	   made public.  However, they need not be documented in the RFC series.
353	   This shall be the first task for the moderator team.  Until those
354	   procedures and criteria are established, all previous processes
355	   referenced in Section 1 shall remain in effect.

357	   The intent of this memo is to provide the widest possible freedom of
358	   action to administrators and moderators, with the expectation that
359	   the minimal actions necessary will be taken.  Those who are directed
360	   to stop disrupting a forum must do so immediately.  Further
361	   disruptions may lead to further corrective actions.

363	   Examples of actions that could be taken include:

365	   *  Automated rate limiting mechanisms;

367	   *  Review and approval of submissions/messages;

369	   *  A private or public admonishment;

371	   *  Temporary or indefinite suspension of participation privileges in
372	      one or more fora.

374	   We stress that these are only examples, and not in any way
375	   prescriptive.  Administrators and moderators are free to decide on
376	   these or other actions.

378	   All moderation actions that restrict participation privileges shall
379	   be immediately reported to those against whom those actions take
380	   effect and to the moderator team for their review.  They shall also
381	   be periodically reported to the IESG.

383	   Only moderation actions suspending participation privileges for
384	   longer than fourteen (14) days must be reported to the forum to which
385	   such an action applies, or in any event, at the request of the
386	   suspended person.  If such an action applies to more than one forum,
387	   it should be communicated to the community in a manner decided by the
388	   IESG.

390	   Moderators will periodically provide an aggregate report to the
391	   community on actions taken under this policy.

393	4.1.  Consistency and Conflict Resolution

395	   Administrators and moderators shall act in a manner consistent with
396	   this memo and the guidelines approved by the IESG.  In cases of
397	   disagreement over a moderation decision, anyone may take the matter
398	   up with the responsible Area Director for resolution, or with the
399	   IETF chair if a responsible Area Director cannot be determined or is
400	   not assigned.  If the disagreement cannot be resolved by the Area
401	   Director, that person may then appeal to the IESG, and subsequently
402	   to the IAB using the processes stated in Sections 6.5.1 and 6.5.4 of
403	   [RFC2026].

405	4.2.  Reinstatement

407	   People and circumstances change.  Individuals whose participation
408	   privileges have been indefinitely suspended from a forum may request
409	   reinstatement.  Requests for reinstatement may be made no earlier
410	   than a year after the initial decision, and then only annually
411	   afterwards.

413	   Any such request must be directed to the entity who made the decision
414	   (e.g., moderator team, working group chairs, etc.) or their
415	   successors.  That party may at their discretion reinstate someone,
416	   conditionally or unconditionally.

418	   To avoid denial-of-service attacks on our processes, decisions to not
419	   reinstate someone's participation privileges may not be appealed.
420	   Any reinstatement is a grace and not a right.

422	   A suspension of participation privileges imposed prior to this
423	   process shall be reconsidered only in accordance with the processes
424	   in place at the time of the suspension, even if the corresponding RFC
425	   has been formally obsoleted.

427	5.  Relationship to other IETF functions

429	5.1.  Relation to the Ombudsteam

431	   Administrators and moderators shall complement the efforts of the
432	   IETF ombudsteam [OT], whose focus on anti-harassment and operation
433	   shall remain unchanged.  Administrators and moderators should always
434	   report suspected harassment.  They should nonetheless take any
435	   necessary actions regarding disruptive behavior.

437	5.2.  Relation to the IETF LLC

439	   The Board of Directors of the IETF Administration LLC (IETF LLC) has
440	   fiduciary duty for the overall organization, which includes the duty
441	   to protect the organization from serious legal risk that may arise
442	   from the behavior of IETF participants.

444	   This protection may include the need for the IETF LLC to take
445	   emergency moderation actions.  These emergency actions are expected
446	   to be taken only when the IETF LLC has received legal advice that
447	   such action is necessary, and therefore extremely rare in frequency.
448	   Some examples of where this might be necessary are:

450	   *  Someone making a credible threat of harm to other IETF
451	      participants.

453	   *  Someone using IETF mailing lists and/or websites to share content
454	      where publishing that content on IETF lists and/or websites brings
455	      serious legal risk to the IETF.

457	   *  Someone making a credible threat of legal action where any form of
458	      interaction with them on IETF mailing lists may have serious legal
459	      consequences for the IETF.

461	   If any such action is taken, the IETF LLC should, except where
462	   limited by legal advice to the contrary, inform the IESG as soon as
463	   possible, providing full details of the subject of the action, nature
464	   of the action, reason for the action and expected duration.  The IETF
465	   LLC should also inform the moderator team and IETF community, except
466	   where it receives legal advice to the contrary.

468	   As such an action would be taken by the IETF LLC in order to protect
469	   the IETF according to its fiduciary duty, then it cannot allow that
470	   to be overridden by a decision of the moderator team or the IESG.
471	   The subject of any such action may request a review by the IETF LLC
472	   board, as documented in section 4.7 of [RFC8711]
473	   Any such action taken by the IETF LLC under this section of this
474	   policy, is not subject to the rest of this policy.

476	6.  Security Considerations

478	   The usual security considerations [RFC3552] do not apply to this
479	   memo.

481	   There is the potential abuse of the moderation procedures by
482	   moderators, working group chairs, and potentially others that could
483	   lead to censorship of legitimate participation.  This potential risk
484	   is mitigated in eight ways:

486	   1.  Section 4 requires the moderator team to first establish
487	       procedures that are intended to apply uniformly across the IETF.

489	   2.  Section 1.2 explicitly states that viewpoints outside the rough
490	       consensus are not in and of themselves disruptive.

492	   3.  Section 4 provides transparency by requiring that moderation
493	       actions that restrict participation privileges be immediately
494	       reported to the affected person and to the moderation team, and
495	       periodically reported to the IESG.

497	   4.  That same section requires that the community be informed in the
498	       case of suspensions lasting longer than 14 days.

500	   5.  Section 4.1 lays out an appeals process in the case of
501	       disagreements.

503	   6.  If moderators find that the procedures themselves are leading to
504	       inappropriate moderation, Section 4 allows them to update those
505	       procedures in consultation with the community, and with the
506	       approval of the IESG.

508	   7.  If IETF participants believe that either the IESG or the IAB are
509	       not performing their respective oversight functions as described
510	       in this document, they may comment to the NomCom [BCP10] or the
511	       community at large.

513	   8.  Finally, if it appears that these processes are not functioning
514	       properly, the policies stated in this memo may be amended.  They
515	       are not set in stone.

517	   Moderation actions are intended to limit the likelihood of disruptive
518	   behavior by a few IETF participants from discouraging participation
519	   by other IETF participants.

521	7.  IANA Considerations

523	   No IANA actions are requested.

847	Appendix B.  Motivation

849	   Section 1 summarized the process changes introduced by this memo.
850	   This appendix discusses the background that led to them.

852	B.1.  Background

854	   The IETF community has defined general guidelines for personal
855	   interactions in the IETF [RFC7154], and the IESG has defined an anti-
856	   harassment policy for the IETF [AHP] for which the IETF community has
857	   defined anti-harassment procedures [RFC7776], empowering an
858	   ombudsteam [OT] to take necessary action.

860	   Dealing with _disruptive_ behavior, however, is not part of the role
861	   of the ombudsteam.  [RFC2418] tasks the chairs of each IETF working
862	   group with moderating their group's in-person meetings while
863	   [RFC3934] provided chairs a procedure to help manage mailing lists.
864	   An IESG statement [MODML] described additional guidance to working
865	   group chairs about how — but not when — to moderate their lists.

867	   For IETF mailing lists not associated with a working group, another
868	   IESG statement [DP] clarifies that the IESG tasks list administrators
869	   with moderation.  And the IETF list for general discussions has,
870	   mostly for historic reasons, a team of moderators that are not list
871	   administrators and operate by a different set of processes [RFC9245].

873	   Note that the term "moderation" can refer both to _preemptive_
874	   moderation, where administrators review attempted participation
875	   before it occurs (such as reviewing messages to a mailing list), and
876	   _reactive_ moderation, where administrators intervene after
877	   disruptive participation has occurred.  The IETF historically mainly
878	   practiced reactive moderation, with a spectrum from gentle reminders
879	   on- and off-list, all the way to suspension of posting rights and
880	   other ways of participating or communicating.  It is up to the
881	   moderators and administrators to decide which mix of preemptive and
882	   reactive moderation to employ as part of their procedures.

884	   In addition, [RFC3683] defines a process for revoking an individual's
885	   posting rights to IETF mailing lists following a community last-call
886	   of a "posting rights" action (PR-action) proposed by the IESG, often
887	   in response to complaints from the community.

889	   Experience and community input suggests that an evolution of the
890	   existing processes is necessary.

892	B.2.  Problems with the Previous Approach

894	   The previous approach to moderation of disruptive participation
895	   through chairs, list administrators, and moderator teams, combined
896	   with the IESG-led process of PR-actions, has proven to be less than
897	   ideal:

899	   *  The IETF community has not been able to agree on a common
900	      definition of disruptive behavior.  Therefore, chairs and list
901	      administrators apply individually different criteria when making
902	      decisions, and participants have different expectations for when
903	      PR-actions are warranted.

905	   *  The moderation process that chairs and list administrators need to
906	      follow [RFC3934] is slow and cumbersome, which makes it ill-suited
907	      to situations that escalate quickly.  It also assumes that the
908	      originator of disruptive behavior is a misguided participant who
909	      can be reasoned with and who will change their ways.

911	   *  Chairs and list administrators may only enact moderation actions
912	      for their single list, which is ill-suited when a pattern of
913	      disruptive behavior spans multiple lists.  Also, chairs and list
914	      administrators may not be fully aware of disruptive behavior that
915	      spans multiple lists, due to not being subscribed to some of them.

917	   *  PR-actions, which can address disruptive behavior across several
918	      lists, are cumbersome and slow, and inconsistent.  This has led to
919	      a situation where PR-actions are rarely used, and when they are
920	      used, they are perceived as very heavy-handed.

922	   *  For a given mailing list, participants may not feel comfortable
923	      reporting disruptive behavior to a chair or list administrator,
924	      for various reasons.  For mailing lists not associated with
925	      working groups, list administrators are not even publicly
926	      identified - they can only be contacted through an anonymous alias
927	      address.  This exacerbates the problem, because participants may
928	      not be comfortable reporting disruptive behavior to an anonymous
929	      party.

931	   *  The IETF offers participation not only through in-person meetings
932	      and mailing lists, which are the two channels of participation for
933	      which moderation processes are currently defined.  IETF business
934	      also happens in chat groups, remote meeting participation systems,
935	      virtual meetings, wikis, GitHub repositories, and more.  How
936	      disruptive behavior is moderated in these fora is currently
937	      undefined.

939	Appendix C.  Non-Normative Examples of Disruptive Behavior

941	   The list below describes some types of disruptive behavior, but it is
942	   non-exhaustive.

944	   *  Discussion of subjects unrelated to a forum's charter or scope;

946	   *  Uncivil commentary, regardless of the general subject;
947	   *  Messages announcing conferences, events, or activities that are
948	      not sponsored or endorsed by the Internet Society or IETF, unless
949	      posted with prior approval of list administrators;

951	   *  Repeatedly arguing counter to a WG charter that has been approved
952	      by the IESG; and

954	   *  "Sealioning", where a participant makes incessant requests for
955	      evidence or data, even while remaining superficially polite.

957	   These items are examples.  Moderators and administrators may take
958	   moderation actions for many other cases.

960	   The moderator team's task consists of subjective judgement calls.
961	   Behaviors not listed here might require moderation, and it is not
962	   possible to write a complete list of all such behaviors.
