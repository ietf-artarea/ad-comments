68	1.  Introduction

70	   The security of the SHA-1 algorithm [RFC3174] has been slowly
71	   diminishing over time as various forms of attacks have weakened its
72	   cryptographic underpinning.  DNSSEC [RFC9364] originally [RFC3110]
73	   made extensive use of SHA-1 as a cryptographic hash algorithm in
74	   RRSIG and Delegation Signer (DS) records, for example.  Since then,
75	   multiple other algorithms with stronger cryptographic strength are
76	   now widely available for DS records and for DNSKEY and RRSIG records.
77	   Readers are encouraged to consider switching to one of the
78	   recommended algorithms listed in the [DNSKEY-IANA] and [DS-IANA]
79	   tables, respectively.  Further, support for validating SHA-1 based
80	   signatures has been removed from some systems.  As a result, SHA-1 is
81	   no longer fully interoperable in the context of DNSSEC.  As adequate
82	   alternatives exist, the use of SHA-1 is no longer advisable.

84	   This document thus further deprecates the use of RSASHA1 and
85	   RSASHA1-NSEC3-SHA1 for DNS Security Algorithms.

87	1.1.  Requirements notation

89	   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
90	   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
91	   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
92	   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
93	   capitals, as shown here.

95	2.  Deprecating RSASHA1 and RSASHA1-NSEC3-SHA1 algorithms in DNSSEC

97	   The RSASHA1 [RFC4034] and RSASHA1-NSEC3-SHA1 [RFC5155] algorithms
98	   MUST NOT be used when creating DNSKEY and RRSIG records.

100	   Validating resolver implementations MUST continue to support
101	   validation using these algorithms as they are diminishing in use but
102	   still actively in use for some domains as of this publication.
103	   Because of RSASHA1 and RSASHA1-NSEC3-SHA1's non-zero use, deployed
104	   validating resolvers MAY be configured to continue to validate RRSIG
105	   records that use these algorithms.  Validating resolvers deployed in
106	   more security strict environments MAY wish to treat these RRSIG
107	   records as an unsupported algorithm.

109	3.  Security Considerations

111	   This document deprecates the use of RSASHA1 and RSASHA1-NSEC3-SHA1
112	   signatures since they are no longer considered to be secure.

114	4.  Operational Considerations

116	   Zone owners currently making use of SHA-1 based algorithms should
117	   immediately switch to algorithms with stronger cryptographic
118	   algorithms, such as the recommended algorithms in the [DNSKEY-IANA]
119	   and [DS-IANA] tables.

121	5.  IANA Considerations

123	   IANA is requested to set the "Use for DNSSEC Delegation" field of the
124	   "Digest Algorithms" registry [DS-IANA] for SHA-1 (1) to MUST NOT.

126	   IANA is requested to set the "Use for DNSSEC Signing" column of the
127	   DNS Security Algorithm Numbers registry [DNSKEY-IANA] to MUST NOT for
128	   the RSASHA1 (5) and RSASHA1-NSEC3-SHA1 (7) algorithms.

130	   All other columns should remain as currently specified.
