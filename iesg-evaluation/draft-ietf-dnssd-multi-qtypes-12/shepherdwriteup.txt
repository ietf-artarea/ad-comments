# Document Shepherd Write-Up for Group Documents

Shepherd: Tim Wicinki

Responsible AD: Eric Vyncke


## Document History

1. Does the working group (WG) consensus represent the strong concurrence of a
few individuals, with others being silent, or did it reach broad agreement?

The WG consensus reached broad agreement.

2. Was there controversy about particular points, or were there decisions where
the consensus was particularly rough?

The draft originally started in DNSOP, even though the work was more relevant
to what was happening in DNSSD.  The DNSOP chairs at the time felt the work
was worth being done, but there was less interest in DNSOP at that time with
other work going on.  Because of this, and the fact this work also fit into
the charter of DNSSD, DNSSD seemed like the most reasonable place for
the work to happen. The DNSOP chairs commented on this:

<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/dnsop/5okVA-DhQZufu4qYQGfT0_zBO0M">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/dnsop/5okVA-DhQZufu4qYQGfT0_zBO0M</a>

In DNSOP, there was some deep discussion on the effects of multi-qtypes in DNSOP,
especially around HTTP/SVCB records:

<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/dnsop/sF9UjTlMQWmjOmr_zx_Xoj-Ia1Q">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/dnsop/sF9UjTlMQWmjOmr_zx_Xoj-Ia1Q</a>

But the discussions appear to reach consensus on the adjustments to the DNS
protocol.   In DNSSD, after reviewing the email discussions, they
were able to reach consensus.

The Working Group Last Call notices went out to both working groups.

3. Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If
so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the
responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this
questionnaire is publicly available.)

No Appeals Threatened

4. For protocol documents, are there existing implementations of the contents of
the document? Have a significant number of potential implementers indicated
plans to implement? Are any existing implementations reported somewhere,
either in the document itself (as [<a href="/doc/rfc7942/">RFC 7942</a>][3] recommends) or elsewhere
(where)?

There have been implementations done during the IETF hackathon.

## Additional Reviews

5. Do the contents of this document closely interact with technologies in other
IETF working groups or external organizations, and would it therefore benefit
from their review? Have those reviews occurred? If yes, describe which
reviews took place.

This was also discussed in DNSOP, with no issues raised.

6. Describe how the document meets any required formal expert review criteria,
such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.

No formal review needed

7. If the document contains a YANG module, has the final version of the module
been checked with any of the [recommended validation tools][4] for syntax and
formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is
the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module
comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified
in [<a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC 8342</a>][5]?

No YANG

8. Describe reviews and automated checks performed to validate sections of the
final version of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code,
BNF rules, MIB definitions, CBOR's CDDL, etc.

N/A

## Document Shepherd Checks

9. Based on the shepherd's review of the document, is it their opinion that this
document is needed, clearly written, complete, correctly designed, and ready
to be handed off to the responsible Area Director?

The document is clearly written, correct, and ready to be handed off.

10. Several IETF Areas have assembled [lists of common issues that their
reviewers encounter][6]. For which areas have such issues been identified
and addressed? For which does this still need to happen in subsequent
reviews?

An early DNSDIR review was done in January
<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/dnsdir/vSpfjxJYcWxacamzc37RdZm0mYQ/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/dnsdir/vSpfjxJYcWxacamzc37RdZm0mYQ/</a>

All other Last Call Reviews should be fine.

11. What type of RFC publication is being requested on the IETF stream ([Best
Current Practice][12], [Proposed Standard, Internet Standard][13],
[Informational, Experimental or Historic][14])? Why is this the proper type
of RFC? Do all Datatracker state attributes correctly reflect this intent?

Proposed Standard is the requested type and the RFC and Datatracker reflect this.
The reasoning for this is that this introduces a slight change to the DNS protocol that
gives the ability to receive multiple DNS Resource Records in a single response.
This change requires that multiple clients and multiple server implementations are able
to interoperate.


12. Have reasonable efforts been made to remind all authors of the intellectual
property rights (IPR) disclosure obligations described in [<a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a>][7]? To
the best of your knowledge, have all required disclosures been filed? If
not, explain why. If yes, summarize any relevant discussion, including links
to publicly-available messages when applicable.

All Authors have been reminded of IPR disclosures.

13. Has each author, editor, and contributor shown their willingness to be
listed as such? If the total number of authors and editors on the front page
is greater than five, please provide a justification.

All Authors are willing to be listed.

14. Document any remaining I-D nits in this document. Simply running the [idnits
tool][8] is not enough; please review the ["Content Guidelines" on
<a href="http://authors.ietf.org">authors.ietf.org</a>][15]. (Also note that the current idnits tool generates
some incorrect warnings; a rewrite is underway.)

ID Nits plus closer inspection have been done. All good.

15. Should any informative references be normative or vice-versa? See the [IESG
Statement on Normative and Informative References][16].

All references appear correctly labelled.

16. List any normative references that are not freely available to anyone. Did
the community have sufficient access to review any such normative
references?

All normative references are freely available

17. Are there any normative downward references (see [<a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>][9] and [<a href="/doc/bcp97/">BCP
97</a>][10]) that are not already listed in the [DOWNREF registry][17]? If so,
list them.

No normative downward references

18. Are there normative references to documents that are not ready to be
submitted to the IESG for publication or are otherwise in an unclear state?
If so, what is the plan for their completion?

All Normative references are in a clear state

19. Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? If
so, does the Datatracker metadata correctly reflect this and are those RFCs
listed on the title page, in the abstract, and discussed in the
introduction? If not, explain why and point to the part of the document
where the relationship of this document to these other RFCs is discussed.

Will not change any existing RFCs

20. Describe the document shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section,
especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document.
Confirm that all aspects of the document requiring IANA assignments are
associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm
that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm
that each newly created IANA registry specifies its initial contents,
allocations procedures, and a reasonable name (see [<a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>][11]).

The IANA Considerations section assigns two new entries in the "DNS EDNS0 Option Codes (OPT)"
Registry.  These have been fully allocated by IANA, and all procedures, registries,
etc. are clear.

21. List any new IANA registries that require Designated Expert Review for
future allocations. Are the instructions to the Designated Expert clear?
Please include suggestions of designated experts, if appropriate.

No new IANA registries.
