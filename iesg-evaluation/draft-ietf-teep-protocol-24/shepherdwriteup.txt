Title: Trusted Execution Environment Provisioning (TEEP) Protocol

Current Version:
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-teep-protocol-15">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-teep-protocol-15</a>

## Document History

1. Does the working group (WG) consensus represent the strong concurrence of a
few individuals, with others being silent, or did it reach broad agreement?

The draft was adopted in Dec, 2017 with good WG support for adoption. It has
been thoroughly reviewed by working group members. The authors have given
updates on progress of the draft during all of the WG meetings. A number of
detailed reviews of the document were posted to the working group mailing list,
along with the issues and pull requests logged on GitHub. Further, there has
been active participation in IETF Hackathon activities from WG members to
implement, test and interop TEEP protocol.  The authors of this document have
extensive experience with the TEE technologies and implementations.

2. Was there controversy about particular points, or were there decisions where
the consensus was particularly rough?

No, there was no controversy about any points in the draft.

3. Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If
so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the
responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this
questionnaire is publicly available.)

There are no open issues that I am aware of, nor any other outstanding areas of
concern, nor are there any known issues of extreme discontent or conflict.

4. For protocol documents, are there existing implementations of the contents of
the document? Have a significant number of potential implementers indicated
plans to implement? Are any existing implementations reported somewhere,
either in the document itself (as [<a href="/doc/rfc7942/">RFC 7942</a>][3] recommends) or elsewhere
(where)?

Multiple open source code repositories of the TEEP protocol is available and
are listed in the "Additional resources" Section of
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-teep-protocol/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-teep-protocol/</a>. The protocol was
implemented and interop was done during IETF hackathons to identify and fix
issues. IETF hackathon reports were presented in the WG meetings.

## Additional Reviews

5. Do the contents of this document closely interact with technologies in other
IETF working groups or external organizations, and would it therefore benefit
from their review? Have those reviews occurred? If yes, describe which
reviews took place.

The TEEP protocol uses CBOR and relies on COSE for security. It leverages the
work in SUIT (SUIT manifest format is used) and RATS (EAT format is used) WGs.
The draft has been reviewed by members actively contributing to these working
groups.

6. Describe how the document meets any required formal expert review criteria,
such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.

No.

7. If the document contains a YANG module, has the final version of the module
been checked with any of the [recommended validation tools][4] for syntax and
formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is
the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module
comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified
in [<a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC 8342</a>][5]?

No.

8. Describe reviews and automated checks performed to validate sections of the
final version of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code,
BNF rules, MIB definitions, CBOR's CDDL, etc.

Yes, CBOR's CDDL validation was done for every commit (see
<a href="https://github.com/ietf-teep/teep-protocol">https://github.com/ietf-teep/teep-protocol</a>)

## Document Shepherd Checks

9. Based on the shepherd's review of the document, is it their opinion that this
document is needed, clearly written, complete, correctly designed, and ready
to be handed off to the responsible Area Director?

Yes, it is ready to be handed off to the responsible AD.

10. Several IETF Areas have assembled [lists of common issues that their
reviewers encounter][6]. For which areas have such issues been identified
and addressed? For which does this still need to happen in subsequent
reviews?

This draft requires reviews from SECDIR and IOTDIR representatives.

11. What type of RFC publication is being requested on the IETF stream ([Best
Current Practice][12], [Proposed Standard, Internet Standard][13],
[Informational, Experimental or Historic][14])? Why is this the proper type
of RFC? Do all Datatracker state attributes correctly reflect this intent?

Proposed Standard as indicated on the title page header and in the datatracker.

12. Have reasonable efforts been made to remind all authors of the intellectual
property rights (IPR) disclosure obligations described in [<a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a>][7]? To
the best of your knowledge, have all required disclosures been filed? If
not, explain why. If yes, summarize any relevant discussion, including links
to publicly-available messages when applicable.

All authors and contributors confirmed that they are not aware of any IPR
related to this draft.

13. Has each author, editor, and contributor shown their willingness to be
listed as such? If the total number of authors and editors on the front page
is greater than five, please provide a justification.

The total number of authors of this specification are 5.

14. Document any remaining I-D nits in this document. Simply running the [idnits
tool][8] is not enough; please review the ["Content Guidelines" on
<a href="http://authors.ietf.org">authors.ietf.org</a>][15]. (Also note that the current idnits tool generates
some incorrect warnings; a rewrite is underway.)

IDnits reported issues and it will be fixed in the next revision.

15. Should any informative references be normative or vice-versa? See the [IESG
Statement on Normative and Informative References][16].

None.

16. List any normative references that are not freely available to anyone. Did
the community have sufficient access to review any such normative
references?

None.

17. Are there any normative downward references (see [<a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>][9] and [<a href="/doc/bcp97/">BCP
97</a>][10]) that are not already listed in the [DOWNREF registry][17]? If so,
list them.

None.

18. Are there normative references to documents that are not ready to be
submitted to the IESG for publication or are otherwise in an unclear state?
If so, what is the plan for their completion?

a) <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-rats-eat/">draft-ietf-rats-eat</a>: submitted to IESG ---&gt; published as RFC
b) <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-suit-manifest/">draft-ietf-suit-manifest</a>: submitted to IESG --&gt; in RFC Editor's Queue
c) <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-suit-trust-domains/">draft-ietf-suit-trust-domains</a>: WGLC done, revised I-D needed --&gt; in IESG
processing. d) <a href="/doc/draft-ietf-suit-mti/">draft-ietf-suit-mti</a>: getting ready for WGLC --&gt; in IETF LC e)
<a href="/doc/draft-ietf-suit-report/">draft-ietf-suit-report</a>: getting ready for WGLC --&gt; in IESG processing.

19. Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? If
so, does the Datatracker metadata correctly reflect this and are those RFCs
listed on the title page, in the abstract, and discussed in the
introduction? If not, explain why and point to the part of the document
where the relationship of this document to these other RFCs is discussed.

No, publication of this document will not change the status of any existing
RFCs.

20. Describe the document shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section,
especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document.
Confirm that all aspects of the document requiring IANA assignments are
associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm
that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm
that each newly created IANA registry specifies its initial contents,
allocations procedures, and a reasonable name (see [<a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>][11]).

It requests IANA to assign a media type for "application/teep+cbor".

21. List any new IANA registries that require Designated Expert Review for
future allocations. Are the instructions to the Designated Expert clear?
Please include suggestions of designated experts, if appropriate.
