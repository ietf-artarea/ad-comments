11	Abstract

13	   This memo describes an RTP payload format for the MPEG-I haptic data.
14	   A haptic media stream is composed of MIHS units including a MIHS
15	   (MPEG-I Haptic Stream) unit header and zero or more MIHS packets.
16	   The RTP Payload header format allows for packetization of a MIHS unit
17	   in an RTP packet payload as well as fragmentation of a MIHS unit into
18	   multiple RTP packets.  The original subtype registration for haptics/
19	   hmpg, registered with IANA in RFC9695, did not include any required
20	   or optional parameters.  This memo updates RFC9695 and the haptics/
21	   hmpg registration to add optional parameters.

86	1.  Introduction

88	   Haptics provides users with tactile effects in addition to audio and
89	   video, allowing them to experience sensory immersion.  Haptic data is
90	   mainly transmitted to devices that act as actuators and provides them
91	   with information to operate according to the values defined in haptic
92	   effects.  The IETF registered haptics as a primary media type akin to
93	   audio and video [RFC9695].

95	   The MPEG Haptics Coding standard [ISO.IEC.23090-31] defines the data
96	   formats, metadata, and codec architecture to encode, decode,
97	   synthesize and transmit haptic signals.  Within this MPEG standard, a
98	   haptic media stream is composed of MIHS units including a MIHS
99	   (MPEG-I Haptic Stream) unit header and zero or more MIHS packets.
100	   The MIHS unit is a unit of packetization suitable for streaming, and
101	   similar in essence to the NAL (Network Abstraction Layer) unit
102	   defined in some video specifications.  This document describes how
103	   haptic data (MIHS units) can be transmitted using the RTP protocol.
104	   This document follows recommendations in [RFC8088] and [RFC2736] for
105	   RTP payload format writers.

107	2.  Conventions

109	   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
110	   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
111	   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
112	   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
113	   capitals, as shown here.

115	3.  Definition

117	   This document uses the definitions of the MPEG Haptics Coding
118	   standard [ISO.IEC.23090-31].  Some of these terms are provided here
119	   for convenience.

121	   Actuator: component of a device for rendering haptic sensations.

123	   Avatar: body (or part of body) representation.

125	   Band: component in a channel for containing effects for a specific
126	   range of frequencies.

128	   Channel: component in a perception containing one or more bands
129	   rendered on a device at a specific body location.

131	   Device: physical system having one or more actuators configured to
132	   render a haptic sensation corresponding with a given signal.

134	   Effect: component of a band for defining a signal, consisting of a
135	   haptic waveform or one or more haptic keyframes.

137	   Experience: top level haptic component containing perceptions and
138	   metadata.

140	   Haptics: tactile sensations.

142	   Keyframe: component of an effect mapping a position in time or space
143	   to an effect parameter such as amplitude or frequency.

145	   Metadata: global information about an experience, perception,
146	   channel, or band.

148	   MIHS unit: unit of packetization of the MPEG-I Haptic Stream format,
149	   which is used as unit of payload in the format described in this
150	   memo.  See Section 4 for details.

152	   Modality: type of haptics, such as vibration, force, pressure,
153	   position, velocity, or temperature.

155	   Perception: haptic perception containing channels of a specific
156	   modality.

158	   Signal: representation of the haptics associated with a specific
159	   modality to be rendered on a device.

161	   Hmpg format: hmpg is a binary compressed format for haptics data.
162	   Information is stored in a binary form and data compression is
163	   applied on data at the band level.  The haptics/hmpg media subtype is
164	   registered in [RFC9695] and updated by this memo.

166	   Independent unit: a MIHS unit is independent if it can be decoded
167	   independently from earlier units.  Independent units contain timing
168	   information and are also called "sync units" in [ISO.IEC.23090-31].

170	   Dependent unit: a MIHS unit is dependent if it requires earlier units
171	   for decoding.  Dependent units do not contain timing information and
172	   are also called "non-sync units" in [ISO.IEC.23090-31].

174	   Time-independent effect: a haptic effect that occurs regardless of
175	   time.  The tactile feedback of a texture is a representative example.
176	   Time-independent effects are encoded in spatial MIHS units, defined
177	   in Section 4.2.

179	   Time-dependent effect: a haptic effect that varies over time.  For
180	   example, tactile feedback for vibration and force are time-dependent
181	   effects, and are encoded in temporal MIHS units, defined in
182	   Section 4.2.

184	4.  Haptic Format Description
185	4.1.  Overview of Haptic Coding

187	   The MPEG Haptics Coding standard specifies methods for efficient
188	   transmission and rendering of haptic signals, to enable immersive
189	   experiences.  It supports multiple types of perceptions, including
190	   the most common vibrotactile (sense of touch that perceives
191	   vibrations) and kinesthetic perceptions (tactile resistance or
192	   force), but also other, less common perceptions, including for
193	   example the sense of temperature or texture.  It also supports two
194	   approaches for encoding haptic signals: a "quantized" approach based
195	   on samples of measured data, and a "descriptive" approach where the
196	   signal is synthesized using a combination of functions.  Both
197	   quantized and descriptive data can be encoded in a human-readable
198	   exchange format based on JSON (.hjif), or in a binary packetized
199	   format for distribution and streaming (.hmpg).  This last format is
200	   referred to as the MPEG-I Haptic Stream (MIHS) format and is a base
201	   for the RTP payload format described in this document.

203	4.2.  MPEG-I Haptic Stream (MIHS) format

205	   MIHS is a stream format used to transport haptic data.  Haptic data
206	   including haptic effects is packetized according to the MIHS format,
207	   and delivered to actuators, which operate according to the provided
208	   effects.  The MIHS format has two levels of packetization, MIHS units
209	   and MIHS packets.

211	   MIHS units are composed of a MIHS unit header and zero or more MIHS
212	   packets.  Four types of MIHS units are defined.  An initialization
213	   MIHS unit contains MIHS packets carrying metadata necessary to reset
214	   and initialize a haptic decoder, including a timestamp.  A temporal
215	   MIHS unit contains one or more MIHS packets defining time-dependent
216	   effects and providing modalities such as pressure, velocity, and
217	   acceleration.  The duration of a temporal unit is a positive number.
218	   A spatial MIHS unit contains one or more MIHS packets providing time-
219	   independent effects, such as vibrotactile texture, stiffness, and
220	   friction.  The duration of a spatial unit is always zero.  A silent
221	   MIHS unit indicates that there is no effect during a time interval
222	   and its duration is a positive number.

224	   A MIHS unit can be marked as independent or dependent.  When a
225	   decoder processes an independent unit, it resets the previous effects
226	   and therefore provides a haptic experience independent from any
227	   previous MIHS unit.  A dependent unit is the continuation of previous
228	   MIHS units and cannot be independently decoded and rendered without
229	   having decoded previous MIHS unit(s).  Initialization and spatial
230	   MIHS units are always independent units.  Temporal and silent MIHS
231	   units can be dependent or independent units.

233	   Figure 1 illustrates a succession of MIHS units in a MIHS stream.

245	5.1.  RTP Header Usage

247	   The RTP header is defined in [RFC3550] and represented in Figure 2.
248	   Some of the header field values are interpreted as follows.

250	    0                   1                   2                   3

263	                      Figure 2: RTP header for Haptic.

265	   Payload type (PT): 7 bits.  The assignment of a payload type MUST be
266	   performed either through the profile used or in a dynamic way.

268	   TimeStamp (TS): 32 bits.  A timeStamp representing the sampling time
269	   of the first sample of the MIHS unit in the RTP payload.  The clock
270	   frequency MUST be set to the sample rate of the encoded haptic data
271	   and is conveyed out-of-band (e.g., as an SDP parameter).

273	   Marker bit (M): 1 bit.  The marker bit SHOULD be set to one in the
274	   first non-silent RTP packet after a period of haptic silence.  This
275	   enables jitter buffer adaptation and haptics device washout (i.e.,
276	   reset to a neutral position) prior to the beginning of the burst with
277	   minimal impact on the quality of experience for the end user.  The
278	   marker bit in all other packets MUST be set to zero.

280	5.2.  Payload Header

282	   The RTP payload header follows the RTP header.  Figure 3 describes
283	   the RTP payload header for Haptic.

291	                  Figure 3: RTP Payload Header for Haptic.

293	   D (Dependency, 1 bit): this field is used to indicate whether the
294	   MIHS unit included in the RTP payload is, when its value is one,
295	   dependent or, when its value is zero, independent.

297	   UT (Unit Type, 3 bits): this field indicates the type of the MIHS
298	   unit included in the RTP payload.  UT field values are listed in
299	   Figure 4.

301	   L (MIHS Layer, 4 bits): this field is an integer value which
302	   indicates the priority order of the MIHS unit included in the RTP
303	   payload, as determined by the haptic sender (e.g., by the haptic
304	   codec), based on application-specific needs.  For example, the sender
305	   may use the MIHS layer to prioritize perceptions with the largest
306	   impact on the end-user experience.  Zero corresponds to the highest
307	   priority.  The semantic of individual MIHS layers are not specified
308	   and left for the application to assign.

310	5.3.  Payload Structures

312	   Three different types of RTP packet payload structures are specified.
313	   A single unit packet contains a single MIHS unit in the payload.  A
314	   fragmentation unit contains a subset of a MIHS unit.  An aggregation
315	   packet contains multiple MIHS units in the payload.  The unit type
316	   (UT) field of the RTP payload header, as shown in Figure 4,
317	   identifies both the payload structure and, in the case of a single-
318	   unit structure, also identifies the type of MIHS unit present in the
319	   payload.

321	   Unit     Payload   Packet Type Name

335	   The payload structures are represented in Figure 5.  The single unit
336	   payload structure is specified in Section 5.3.1.  The fragmented unit
337	   payload structure is specified in Section 5.3.2.  The aggregation
338	   packet payload structure is specified in Section 5.3.3.

358	5.3.1.  Single Unit Payload Structure

360	   In a single unit payload structure, as described in Figure 6, the RTP
361	   packet contains the RTP header, followed by the payload header and
362	   one single MIHS unit.  The payload header follows the structure
363	   described in Section 5.2.  The payload contains a MIHS unit as
364	   defined in [ISO.IEC.23090-31].

380	5.3.2.  Fragmented Unit Payload Structure

382	   In a fragmented unit payload structure, as described in Figure 7, the
383	   RTP packet contains the RTP header, followed by the payload header, a
384	   Fragmented Unit (FU) header, and a MIHS unit fragment.  The payload
385	   header follows the structure described in Section 5.2.  The value of
386	   the UT field of the payload header is 7.  The FU header follows the
387	   structure described in Figure 8.

401	               Figure 7: Fragmentation Unit Payload Structure

403	   FU headers are used to enable fragmenting a single MIHS unit into
404	   multiple RTP packets.  Fragments of the same MIHS unit MUST be sent
405	   in consecutive order with ascending RTP sequence numbers (with no
406	   other RTP packets within the same RTP stream being sent between the
407	   first and last fragment).  FUs MUST NOT be nested, i.e., an FU MUST
408	   NOT contain a subset of another FU.

410	   Figure 8 describes a FU header, including the following fields:

412	   +-------------------------------+
413	   | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
414	   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
415	   |FUS|FUE|   RSV     |     UT    |
416	   +---+---+-----------+-----------+

418	                    Figure 8: Fragmentation unit header

420	   FUS (Fragmented Unit Start, 1 bit): this field MUST be set to 1 for
421	   the first fragment, and 0 for the other fragments.

423	   FUE (Fragmented Unit End, 1 bit): this field MUST be set to 1 for the
424	   last fragment, and 0 for the other fragments.

426	   RSV (Reserved, 3 bits): these bits MUST be set to 0 by the sender and
427	   ignored by the receiver.

429	   UT (Unit Type, 3 bits): this field indicates the type of the MIHS
430	   unit this fragment belongs to, using values defined in Figure 4.

432	   The use of MIHS unit fragmentation in RTP means that a media receiver
433	   can receive some fragments, but not other fragments.  The missing
434	   fragments will typically not be retransmitted by RTP.  This results
435	   in partially received MIHS units, which can be either dropped or used
436	   by the decoding application, based on implementation.

438	5.3.3.  Aggregation Packet Payload Structure

440	   In an aggregation packet, as described in Figure 9, the RTP packet
441	   contains an RTP header, followed by a payload header, and, for each
442	   aggregated MIHS Unit, a MIHS unit size followed by the MIHS unit.
443	   The payload header follows the structure described in Section 5.2.

464	                  Figure 9: Single-Time Aggregation Packet

466	   Figure 9 shows a Single-Time Aggregation Packet (STAP), which can be
467	   used to transmit multiple MIHS units that correspond to the same
468	   timestamp.  For example, if two frequencies are used for the same
469	   content, they can be transmitted at once in a STAP.  Multiple spatial
470	   units can also be sent together in a STAP, since this type of haptics
471	   data is time independent.  The MIHS unit length field (16 bits) holds
472	   the length of the MIHS unit following it, in bytes.  The value of the
473	   UT field of the payload header is 5.

496	                Figure 10: Multiple-time aggregation packet

498	   Figure 10 shows a multi-time aggregation packet.  It is used to
499	   transmit multiple MIHS units with different timestamps, in one RTP
500	   packet.  Multi-time aggregation can help reduce the number of
501	   packets, in environments where some delay is acceptable.  The value
502	   of the UT field of the Payload Header is 6.  The MIHS unit length
503	   field (16 bits) holds the length of the MIHS unit following it, in
504	   bytes.  The timestamp offset field (TS offset, 16 bits) is present in
505	   the MTAP case, and MUST be set to the value of (time of the MIHS unit
506	   - RTP timestamp of the packet).  The timestamp offset of the earliest
507	   aggregation unit MUST always be zero.  Therefore, the RTP timestamp
508	   of the MTAP is identical to the earliest MIHS unit time.

510	5.4.  MIHS Units Transmission Considerations

512	   The following considerations apply for the streaming of MIHS units
513	   over RTP:

515	   The MIHS format enables variable duration units and uses
516	   initialization MIHS units to declare the duration of subsequent non-
517	   zero duration MIHS units, as well as the maximum variation of this
518	   duration.  A sender SHOULD set constant or low-variability (e.g.,
519	   lower than the playout buffer) durations in initialization MIHS
520	   units, for RTP streaming.  This enables the receiver to determine
521	   early (e.g., using a timer) when a unit has been lost and make the
522	   decoder more robust to RTP packet loss.  If a sender sends MIHS units
523	   with high duration variations, the receiver MAY need to wait for a
524	   long period of time (e.g., the upper bound of the duration
525	   variation), to determine if a MIHS unit was lost in transmission.
526	   Whether this behavior is acceptable or not is application dependent.

528	   The MIHS format uses silent MIHS units to signal haptic silence.  A
529	   sender MAY decide not to send silent units, to save network
530	   resources.  Since, from a receiver standpoint, a missed MIHS unit MAY
531	   originate from a not-sent silent unit, or a lost packet, a sender MAY
532	   send one, or a few, MIHS silent units at the beginning of a haptic
533	   silence.  If a media receiver receives a MIHS silent unit, the
534	   receiver SHOULD assume that silence is intended until the reception
535	   of a non-silent MIHS unit.  This can reduce the number of false
536	   detections of lost RTP packets by the decoder.

538	   In some multimedia conference scenarios using an RTP video mixer
539	   (e.g., when adding or selecting a new source), it is recommended to
540	   use Full Intra Request (FIR) feedback messages with Haptics
541	   [RFC5104].  The purpose of the FIR message is to cause an encoder to
542	   send a decoder refresh point at the earliest opportunity.  In the
543	   context of haptics, an appropriate decoder refresh point is an
544	   initialization MIHS unit.  The initialization MIHS unit point enables
545	   a decoder to be reset to a known state and be able decode all MIHS
546	   units following it.

548	6.  Payload Format Parameters

550	   This section describes payload format parameters.  Section 6.1
551	   updates the 'haptics' Media Type Registration and Section 6.2
552	   specifies new optional parameters.  Section 6.3 further registers a
553	   new token in the media sub-registry of the Session Description
554	   Protocols (SDP) Parameters registry.

556	6.1.  Media Type Registration Update

558	   This memo updates the 'hmpg' haptic subtype defined in [RFC9695] for
559	   use with the MPEG-I haptics streamable binary coding format described
560	   in ISO/IEC 23090-31: Haptics coding [ISO.IEC.23090-31].  This memo
561	   especially defines optional parameters for this type in Section 6.2.
562	   The original subtype registration for haptics/hmpg, registered with
563	   IANA in [RFC9695], did not include any required or optional
564	   parameters.  This document introduces optional parameters to enable
565	   extended functionality while maintaining backward compatibility.

567	   A mapping of the parameters into the Session Description Protocol
568	   (SDP) [RFC8866] is also provided for applications that use SDP.
569	   Equivalent parameters could be defined elsewhere for use with control
570	   protocols that do not use SDP.  The receiver MUST ignore any
571	   parameter unspecified in this memo.

573	   The following entries identify the media type being updated:

575	   Type name: haptics

577	   Subtype name: hmpg

579	   The following entries are replaced by this memo:

581	   Optional parameters: see section 6.2 of RFC XXX (note to RFC editor:
582	   replace with this RFC's number).

658	6.3.  SDP Parameter Registration

660	   This memo registers a 'haptics' token in the media sub-registry of
661	   the Session Description Protocols (SDP) Parameters registry.  This
662	   registration contains the required information elements outlined in
663	   the SDP registration procedure defined in section 8.2 of [RFC8866].

665	   (1) Contact Information:

667	          Name: Hyunsik Yang
668	          Email: hyunsik.yang@interdigital.com

670	   (2) Name being registered (as it will appear in SDP): haptics

672	   (3) Long-form name in English: haptics

674	   (4) Type of name ('media', 'proto', 'fmt', 'bwtype', 'nettype', or
675	   'addrtype'): media

677	   (5) Purpose of the registered name:

679	          The 'haptics' media type for the Session Description Protocol
680	          is used to describe a media stream whose content can be
681	          rendered as touch-related sensations.
682	          The media subtype further describes the specific
683	          format of the haptics stream.  The 'haptics' media type for
684	          SDP is used to establish haptics media streams.

686	   (6) Specification for the registered name: RFC XXXX

688	   RFC Editor Note: Replace RFC XXXX with the published RFC number.

690	7.  SDP Considerations

692	   The mapping of above defined payload format media type to the
693	   corresponding fields in the Session Description Protocol (SDP) is
694	   done according to [RFC8866].

696	   The media name in the "m=" line of SDP MUST be haptics.

698	   The encoding name in the "a=rtpmap" line of SDP MUST be hmpg

700	   The clock rate in the "a=rtpmap" line MAY be any sampling rate,
701	   typically 8000.

703	   The OPTIONAL parameters (defined in Section 6.2), when present, MUST
704	   be included in the "a=fmtp" line of SDP.  This is expressed as a
705	   media type string, in the form of a semicolon-separated list of
706	   parameter=value pairs.

708	   An example of media representation corresponding to the hmpg RTP
709	   payload in SDP is as follows:

711	   m=haptics 43291 UDP/TLS/RTP/SAVPF 115
712	   a=rtpmap:115 hmpg/8000
713	   a=fmtp:115 profile=main;lvl=1;ver=2023

715	7.1.  SDP Offer/Answer Considerations

717	   When using the offer/answer procedure described in [RFC3264] to
718	   negotiate the use of haptic, the following considerations apply:

720	   When used for a unidirectional stream, the SDP parameters represent
721	   the properties of the sender (on the sending side) and of the
722	   receiver (on the receiving side).  When used for a sendrecv stream,
723	   the SDP parameters represent the properties of the receiver.

725	   The receiver properties expressed using the SDP parameters 'ver',
726	   'profile' and 'lvl' have a mandatory character, since they represent
727	   implementation capabilities.  The ver, profile, lvl parameters MUST
728	   be used symmetrically in SDP offer and answer.  That is, their values
729	   in the answer MUST match those in the offer, either explicitly
730	   signaled or implicitly inferred.  In the same session, ver, profile,
731	   and lvl MUST NOT be changed in subsequent offers or answers.

733	   The properties expressed using SDP parameters other than 'ver',
734	   'profile' and 'lvl' are provided as recommendations for efficient
735	   data transmission and are not binding, meaning that a sender is
736	   encouraged but not required to conform to the parameters specified by
737	   the receiver.  These properties MAY be set to different values in
738	   offers and answers.  These properties MAY be updated in subsequent
739	   offers or answers.

741	   Any receiver compliant with [ISO.IEC.23090-31] MUST accept any stream
742	   with a compatible version, profile and level.  A receiver supporting
743	   a more general profile will accept a stream corresponding to a same
744	   or less general profile (e.g., "main" is more general than "simple-
745	   parametric").  A receiver supporting a given level will accept a
746	   stream corresponding to a same or lower level.  A receiver supporting
747	   a given version will accept a stream corresponding to the same
748	   version and MAY accept other versions.  A receiver MAY ignore any
749	   part of a received stream, e.g., that it does not have support for
750	   rendering.

752	   The haptic signal can be sampled at different rates.  The MPEG
753	   Haptics Coding standard does not mandate a specific frequency.  A
754	   typical sample rate is 8000Hz.

756	   The parameter 'ver' indicates the version of the haptic standard
757	   specification.  If it is not specified, the initial version of the
758	   MPEG Haptic Coding specification SHOULD be assumed, although the
759	   sender and receiver MAY use a specific value based on an out-of-band
760	   agreement.  The parameter 'profile' is used to restrict the number of
761	   tools used (e.g., the simple-parametric profile fits enable simpler
762	   implementations than the main profile).  If it is not specified, the
763	   most general profile "main" SHOULD be assumed, although the sender
764	   and receiver MAY use a specific value based on an out-of-band
765	   agreement.  The parameter 'lvl' is used to further characterize
766	   implementations within a given profile, e.g., according to the
767	   maximum supported number of channels, bands, and perceptions.  If it
768	   is not specified, the most general level "2" SHOULD be assumed,
769	   although the sender and receiver MAY use a specific version based on
770	   an out-of-band agreement.  Other parameters can be used to indicate
771	   bitstream properties as well as receiver capabilities.  The
772	   parameters 'maxlod', 'avtypes', 'bodypartmask', 'maxfreq', 'minfreq',
773	   'dvctypes', and 'modalities' can be sent by a sender to reflect the
774	   characteristics of bitstreams and can be set by a receiver to reflect
775	   the nature and capabilities of local actuator devices, or a preferred
776	   set of bitstream properties.  For example, different receivers MAY
777	   have different sets of local actuators, in which case these
778	   parameters can be used to select a stream adapted to the receiver.
779	   In some other cases, some receivers MAY indicate a preference for a
780	   set of bitstream properties such as perceptions, min/max frequency,
781	   or body-part-mask, which contribute the most to the user experience
782	   for a given application, in which case these parameters can be used
783	   to select a stream which include and possibly prioritizes those
784	   properties.  For example, if the haptic stream server provides more
785	   information than the body mask specified by the receiver, the
786	   additional information can be either integrated into a single effect
787	   or ignored by the receiver.

789	   The parameter 'silencesupp' can be used to indicate sender and
790	   receiver capabilities or preferences.  This parameter indicates
791	   whether silence suppression SHOULD be used, as described in
792	   Section 5.4.

794	7.2.  Declarative SDP Considerations

796	   When haptic content over RTP is offered with SDP in a declarative
797	   style, the parameters capable of indicating both bitstream properties
798	   as well as receiver capabilities are used to indicate only bitstream
799	   properties.  For example, in this case, the parameters maxlod,
800	   bodypartmask, maxfreq, minfreq, dvctypes, and modalities declare the
801	   values used by the bitstream, not the capabilities for receiving
802	   bitstreams.  A receiver of the SDP is required to support all
803	   parameters and values of the parameters provided; otherwise, the
804	   receiver MUST reject or not participate in the session.  It falls on
805	   the creator of the session to use values that are expected to be
806	   supported by the receiving application.

808	8.  Congestion Control Considerations

810	   The general congestion control considerations for transporting RTP
811	   data apply to HMPG haptics over RTP as well [RFC3550].

813	   It is possible to adapt network bandwidth usage by adjusting either
814	   the encoder bit rate or by adjusting the stream content (e.g., level
815	   of detail, body parts, actuator frequency range, target device types,
816	   modalities).

818	   In case of congestion, a receiver or intermediate node MAY prioritize
819	   independent packets over dependent ones, since the non-reception of
820	   an independent MIHS unit can prevent the decoding of multiple
821	   subsequent dependent MIHS units.  In case of congestion, a receiver
822	   or intermediate node MAY prioritize initialization MIHS units over
823	   other units, since initialization MIHS units contain metadata used to
824	   re-initialize the decoder, and MAY drop silent MIHS units before
825	   other types of MIHS units, since a receiver MAY interpret a missing
826	   MIHS unit as a silence.  It is also possible, using the layer field
827	   of the RTP payload header, to allocate MIHS units to different layers
828	   based on their content, to prioritize haptic data contributing the
829	   most to the user experience.  In case of congestion, intermediate
830	   nodes and receivers SHOULD use the MIHS layer value to determine the
831	   relative importance of haptic RTP packets.

833	9.  Security Considerations

835	   This RTP payload format is subject to security threats commonly
836	   associated with RTP payload formats, as well as threats specific to
837	   the interaction of haptic devices with the physical world, and
838	   threats associated with the use of compression by the codec.
839	   Security consideration for threats commonly associated with RTP
840	   payload formats are outlined in [RFC3550], as well as in RTP profiles
841	   such as RTP/AVP [RFC3551]), RTP/AVPF [RFC4585], RTP/SAVP [RFC3711],
842	   or RTP/SAVPF [RFC5124].

844	   Haptic sensors and actuators operate within the physical environment.
845	   This introduces the potential for information leakage through
846	   sensors, or damage to actuators due to data tampering.  Additionally,
847	   misusing the functionalities of actuators (such as force, position,
848	   temperature, vibration, electro-tactile, etc.)  MAY pose a risk of
849	   harm to the user, for example by setting keyframe parameters (e.g.,
850	   amplitude, position, frequency) or channel gain to a value that
851	   surpasses a permissible range.  While individual devices can
852	   implement security measures to reduce or eliminate those risks on a
853	   per-device basis, in some cases harm can be inflicted by setting
854	   values which are permissible for the individual device.  For example,
855	   causing contact with the physical environment or triggering
856	   unexpected force feedback can potentially harm the user.  Each haptic
857	   system should therefore implement system-dependent security measures,
858	   which are more error prone.  To limit the risk that attackers exploit
859	   weaknesses in haptic systems, it is important that haptic
860	   transmission should be protected against malicious traffic injection
861	   or tampering.

863	   However, as "Securing the RTP Framework: Why RTP Does Not Mandate a
864	   Single Media Security Solution" [RFC7202] discusses, it is not an RTP
865	   payload format's responsibility to discuss or mandate what solutions
866	   are used to meet the basic security goals like confidentiality,
867	   integrity, and source authenticity for RTP in general.  The
868	   responsibility for implementing security mechanisms lies with the
869	   application developer.  They can find guidance on available security
870	   mechanisms and important considerations in "Options for Securing RTP
871	   Sessions" [RFC7201].  Applications SHOULD use one or more appropriate
872	   strong security mechanisms.

874	   The haptic codec used with this payload format uses a compression
875	   algorithm (see sections 8.2.8.5 and 8.3.3.2 in [ISO.IEC.23090-31]).
876	   An attacker MAY inject pathological datagrams into the stream which
877	   are complex to decode and cause the receiver to be overloaded,
878	   similarly to [RFC3551].

880	   End-to-end security with authentication, integrity, or
881	   confidentiality protection will prevent a Media-Aware Network Element
882	   (MANE) from performing media-aware operations other than discarding
883	   complete packets.  In the case of confidentiality protection, it will
884	   even be prevented from discarding packets in a media-aware way.  To
885	   be allowed to perform such operations, a MANE is required to be a
886	   trusted entity that is included in the security context
887	   establishment.
