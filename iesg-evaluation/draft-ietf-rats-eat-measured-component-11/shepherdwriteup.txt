# Document History

1. Does the working group (WG) consensus represent the strong concurrence of a
few individuals, with others being silent, or did it reach broad agreement?

The document has received reviews and feedback from at least 10 people involved
in the RATS WG, across multiple channels (IETF meetings, mailing list, Github
issues). The reviewer group spans a wide range of backgrounds (academic,
confidential computing, networking infrastructure, IoT). All sections of the
document have been refined through the review process.

There is a strong consensus among interested participants.

2. Was there controversy about particular points, or were there decisions where
the consensus was particularly rough?

The only lengthy discussion which didn't lead to a single unanimous decision
was the naming of "authorities" (formerly "signers") in the information model
[signers-renaming] [signer-section]. Renaming was needed because most (if not
all) reviewers displayed some level of confusion as to the semantics of the
field. The original term - "signers" - seemed to bias readers towards assuming
the field indicated entities who had signed the Measured Component, not those
who signed the component itself to authorize its installation or use.

No other discussions caused controversy, or needed rough consensus for progress
to be made.

3. Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If
so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the
responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this
questionnaire is publicly available.)

I am not aware of such instances.

4. For protocol documents, are there existing implementations of the contents of
the document? Have a significant number of potential implementers indicated
plans to implement? Are any existing implementations reported somewhere,
either in the document itself (as <a href="/doc/rfc7942/">RFC 7942</a> recommends) or elsewhere
(where)?

A Go language implementation exists [Go-EAT], and is integrated into a library
providing support for Entity Attestation Tokens.

# Additional Reviews

5. Do the contents of this document closely interact with technologies in other
IETF working groups or external organizations, and would it therefore benefit
from their review? Have those reviews occurred? If yes, describe which
reviews took place.

The scope of the document can be broken up into a generic information model,
and an EAT-specific data model.

The data model has limited scope outside the RATS WG.

The information model could in theory be used more broadly, both in other IETF
WGs or in other SDOs, to convey the components of a system. For example, the
issue of compatibility with the TCG-defined Canonical Event Log has been
brought up by a member of the RATS WG. Direct engagement with the TCG on this
topic showed limited interest on their side in use of the info model. This
position has also been summarised on the mailing list [tcg-summary].

Other external reviews of the information model (with a goal of inclusion in
another data format) have not been forthcoming.

6. Describe how the document meets any required formal expert review criteria,
such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.

The document defines registrations for two new media types, as well as
associated CoAP Content Formats. An early review of the media type registration
requests has been performed [early-iana-review].

CoAP Content Format expert review has taken place, and feedback incorporated
[coap-cf-review].

7. If the document contains a YANG module, has the final version of the module
been checked with any of the recommended validation tools for syntax and
formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is
the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module
comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified
in <a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC 8342</a>?

Document does not contain YANG modules.

8. Describe reviews and automated checks performed to validate sections of the
final version of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code,
BNF rules, MIB definitions, CBOR's CDDL, etc.

The document contains CDDL, as well as CBOR and JSON examples. These have been
improved repeatedly through reviews from multiple WG members, including experts
(e.g., [fix-flags-size]).

CI on the draft repo automatically checks for the validity of the combined
CDDL, as well as correctness of examples against this CDDL (see `Build Drafts`
step in [CDDL-CI] jobs). Since the data model offered in the draft is meant for
inclusion in Entity Attestation Tokens, the CI also checks that this
integration is possible.

# Document Shepherd Checks

9. Based on the shepherd's review of the document, is it their opinion that this
document is needed, clearly written, complete, correctly designed, and ready
to be handed off to the responsible Area Director?

The document is ready for AD evaluation. It was created to address a clear
need. Ample feedback has confirmed the utility, and helped refine the content
and its presentation.

NOTE: Deb's AD review (and reply from document editors) can be found here
[ad-review].

10. Several IETF Areas have assembled lists of common issues that their
reviewers encounter. For which areas have such issues been identified
and addressed? For which does this still need to happen in subsequent
reviews?

No early expert reviews from any IETF areas / directorates have been performed.
Reviews from the following areas would be beneficial:

* IoTDir: IoT devices would be prime territory for use of this draft. (Update:
no IoT review requested)

* ART ART: for review of the data model. Review available at [artart-review].

* SecDir: for review of both the security and privacy implications of the
draft. Review available at [sec-review].

* Gen-ART: review will be available at [genart-review].

11. What type of RFC publication is being requested on the IETF stream (Best
Current Practice, Proposed Standard, Internet Standard,
Informational, Experimental or Historic)? Why is this the proper type
of RFC? Do all Datatracker state attributes correctly reflect this intent?

Proposed Standard is being requested, which is appropriate given that the
document defines a protocol-level data structure intended for use as an
extension to EAT, which is also a Proposed Standard RFC. Datatracker metadata
reflects this intent.

12. Have reasonable efforts been made to remind all authors of the intellectual
property rights (IPR) disclosure obligations described in <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a>? To
the best of your knowledge, have all required disclosures been filed? If
not, explain why. If yes, summarize any relevant discussion, including links
to publicly-available messages when applicable.

IPR disclosure reminder has been sent [IPR-Q]. All authors have confirmed the
lack of applicable patents. No disclosures have been filed yet, as far as I
know.

13. Has each author, editor, and contributor shown their willingness to be
listed as such? If the total number of authors and editors on the front page
is greater than five, please provide a justification.

Question was sent on mailing list [authorship-Q]. All authors have confirmed.

14. Document any remaining I-D nits in this document. Simply running the idnits
tool is not enough; please review the "Content Guidelines" on
<a href="http://authors.ietf.org">authors.ietf.org</a>. (Also note that the current idnits tool generates
some incorrect warnings; a rewrite is underway.)

I-D nits checking reveals no errors, no flaws, and one warning (a non-ASCII
character in a name in the acknowledgements list, "Ionuț").

All other content guidelines seemed to be fulfilled.

15. Should any informative references be normative or vice-versa? See the IESG
Statement on Normative and Informative References.

No.

16. List any normative references that are not freely available to anyone. Did
the community have sufficient access to review any such normative
references?

All normative references are freely available.

17. Are there any normative downward references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp97/">BCP
97</a>) that are not already listed in the DOWNREF registry? If so,
list them.

No normative downward references are present.

18. Are there normative references to documents that are not ready to be
submitted to the IESG for publication or are otherwise in an unclear state?
If so, what is the plan for their completion?

No such references exist in this document.

19. Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? If
so, does the Datatracker metadata correctly reflect this and are those RFCs
listed on the title page, in the abstract, and discussed in the
introduction? If not, explain why and point to the part of the document
where the relationship of this document to these other RFCs is discussed.

No changes to the status of existing RFCs are being made.

20. Describe the document shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section,
especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document.
Confirm that all aspects of the document requiring IANA assignments are
associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm
that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm
that each newly created IANA registry specifies its initial contents,
allocations procedures, and a reasonable name (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>).

The IANA section is consistent with the body of the document, and describes
correctly (as far as I can tell) registration requests for two media types (one
for a CBOR measured component, one for a JSON one), along with two new
associated CoAP Content Format IDs. The registration requests label the correct
registries clearly, and provide all the required metadata.

21. List any new IANA registries that require Designated Expert Review for
future allocations. Are the instructions to the Designated Expert clear?
Please include suggestions of designated experts, if appropriate.
