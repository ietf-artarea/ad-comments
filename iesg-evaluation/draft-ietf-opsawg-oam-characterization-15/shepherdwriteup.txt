# Document Shepherd Write-Up for Group Documents

*This version is dated 4 July 2022.*

Thank you for your service as a document shepherd. Among the responsibilities is
answering the questions in this write-up to give helpful context to Last Call
and Internet Engineering Steering Group ([IESG][1]) reviewers, and your
diligence in completing it is appreciated. The full role of the shepherd is
further described in [<a href="/doc/rfc4858/">RFC 4858</a>][2]. You will need the cooperation of the authors
and editors to complete these checks.

Note that some numbered items contain multiple related questions; please be sure
to answer all of them.

## Document History

1. Does the working group (WG) consensus represent the strong concurrence of a
few individuals, with others being silent, or did it reach broad agreement?

There was some controversies during the lifetime of this draft, mainly from one
particular individual, up to the point where the document was stalled after a
first WGLC. A new document shepherd and the additional of a third author (Tal)
brought new perspective (and new blood) to the document. A second WGLC helped
successfully resolved the remaining issues.

Review requests were shared early in the process with relevant WGs (MPLS, BESS,
IPPM, DETNET, etc.). This was done by the authors and also the first document
shepherd.

Clarifications of some specific points involved other groups (PALS, PW3, in
particular). That feedback helped confirm the position recorded in the draft
about path congruence and QoS treatment. See more at [18].

The document was presented and discussed in IPPM plenary sessions. That
discussion was helpful.

The 2nd WGLC was also shared with IPPM (as some of raised issues are related to
a spec owned by IPPM). No concern was raised in that IPPM thread [19].

Note: in advance of the AD review, Med provided some feedback

doc:
<a href="https://github.com/boucadair/IETF-Drafts-Reviews/blob/master/2025/draft-ietf-opsawg-oam-characterization-13-rev%20Med.doc">https://github.com/boucadair/IETF-Drafts-Reviews/blob/master/2025/draft-ietf-opsawg-oam-characterization-13-rev%20Med.doc</a>
This would deserve a new draft revision.

2. Was there controversy about particular points, or were there decisions where
the consensus was particularly rough?

In the end, I believe all individuals are either happy, or can live with the
document status and certainly eager to get this RFC published (read: over their
shoulder)

3. Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If
so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the
responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this
questionnaire is publicly available.)

No.

4. For protocol documents, are there existing implementations of the contents of
the document? Have a significant number of potential implementers indicated
plans to implement? Are any existing implementations reported somewhere,
either in the document itself (as [<a href="/doc/rfc7942/">RFC 7942</a>][3] recommends) or elsewhere
(where)?

There are no implementations, as this document discusses guidelines for
characterizing OAM.

## Additional Reviews

5. Do the contents of this document closely interact with technologies in other
IETF working groups or external organizations, and would it therefore benefit
from their review? Have those reviews occurred? If yes, describe which
reviews took place.

This document covers some technologies in IPPM, where it was presented.
Next to IPPM, feedback was collected from the following mailing lists: DETNET,
IPv6, MPLS.

6. Describe how the document meets any required formal expert review criteria,
such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.

Not applicable.

7. If the document contains a YANG module, has the final version of the module
been checked with any of the [recommended validation tools][4] for syntax and
formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is
the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module
comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified
in [<a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC 8342</a>][5]?

Not applicable.

8. Describe reviews and automated checks performed to validate sections of the
final version of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code,
BNF rules, MIB definitions, CBOR's CDDL, etc.

Not applicable.

## Document Shepherd Checks

9. Based on the shepherd's review of the document, is it their opinion that this
document is needed, clearly written, complete, correctly designed, and ready
to be handed off to the responsible Area Director?

Yes.

10. Several IETF Areas have assembled [lists of common issues that their
reviewers encounter][6]. For which areas have such issues been identified
and addressed? For which does this still need to happen in subsequent
reviews?

The OPSDIR and GENART reviews were executed and the feedback inserted in the
last document revision.

11. What type of RFC publication is being requested on the IETF stream ([Best
Current Practice][12], [Proposed Standard, Internet Standard][13],
[Informational, Experimental or Historic][14])? Why is this the proper type
of RFC? Do all Datatracker state attributes correctly reflect this intent?

BCP publication is being requested; the document content fits the [12]
description. Datatracker does correctly reflect the intended status.

The intended status is appropriate as this is an update to <a href="/doc/rfc6291/">RFC 6291</a>.

12. Have reasonable efforts been made to remind all authors of the intellectual
property rights (IPR) disclosure obligations described in [<a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a>][7]? To
the best of your knowledge, have all required disclosures been filed? If
not, explain why. If yes, summarize any relevant discussion, including links
to publicly-available messages when applicable.

Yes.

13. Has each author, editor, and contributor shown their willingness to be
listed as such? If the total number of authors and editors on the front page
is greater than five, please provide a justification.

Yes, all authors have shown willingness to be authors and to respond to
comments and prompts.

14. Document any remaining I-D nits in this document. Simply running the [idnits
tool][8] is not enough; please review the ["Content Guidelines" on
<a href="http://authors.ietf.org">authors.ietf.org</a>][15]. (Also note that the current idnits tool generates
some incorrect warnings; a rewrite is underway.)'

One IDNITS remaining, as flagged in the datatracker (and by Med).

** The abstract seems to contain references ([<a href="/doc/rfc6291/">RFC6291</a>]), which it
shouldn't.  Please replace those with straight textual mentions of the
documents in question.

15. Should any informative references be normative or vice-versa? See the [IESG
Statement on Normative and Informative References][16].

Med, as responsible AD, flagged that <a href="/doc/rfc7799/">RFC7799</a> should be normative.

16. List any normative references that are not freely available to anyone. Did
the community have sufficient access to review any such normative
references?

No.  All normative references are within the IETF.

17. Are there any normative downward references (see [<a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>][9] and [<a href="/doc/bcp97/">BCP
97</a>][10]) that are not already listed in the [DOWNREF registry][17]? If so,
list them.

No.

18. Are there normative references to documents that are not ready to be
submitted to the IESG for publication or are otherwise in an unclear state?
If so, what is the plan for their completion?

No.

19. Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? If
so, does the Datatracker metadata correctly reflect this and are those RFCs
listed on the title page, in the abstract, and discussed in the
introduction? If not, explain why and point to the part of the document
where the relationship of this document to these other RFCs is discussed.

No.

20. Describe the document shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section,
especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document.
Confirm that all aspects of the document requiring IANA assignments are
associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm
that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm
that each newly created IANA registry specifies its initial contents,
allocations procedures, and a reasonable name (see [<a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>][11]).

This document has no IANA actions.

21. List any new IANA registries that require Designated Expert Review for
future allocations. Are the instructions to the Designated Expert clear?
Please include suggestions of designated experts, if appropriate.

Not applicable.
