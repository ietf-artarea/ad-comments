10	                  Guidelines for Characterizing "OAM"
11	               draft-ietf-opsawg-oam-characterization-15

13	Abstract

15	   As the IETF continues to produce and standardize different
16	   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) protocols and
17	   technologies, various qualifiers and modifiers are prepended to the
18	   OAM abbreviation.  While, at first glance, the most used appear to be
19	   well understood, the same qualifier may be interpreted differently in
20	   different contexts.  A case in point is the qualifiers "in-band" and
21	   "out-of-band" which have their origins in the radio lexicon, and
22	   which have been extrapolated into other communication networks.  This
23	   document recommends not to use these two terms when referring to OAM.

25	   This document considers some common qualifiers and modifiers that are
26	   prepended, within the context of packet networks, to the OAM
27	   abbreviation and lays out guidelines for their use in future IETF
28	   work.

30	   This document updates RFC6291 by adding to the guidelines for the use
31	   of the term "OAM".  It does not modify any other part of RFC6291.

33	Status of This Memo

84	1.  Introduction

86	   It is not uncommon for historical and popular terms to have nuances
87	   in how they are interpreted or understood.  This was, for example,
88	   the case with the abbreviation for Operations, Administration, and
89	   Maintenance, "OAM", and [RFC6291] provides guidelines for its use as
90	   well as definitions of its constituent parts.

92	   Characterizations or qualifiers for "OAM" within packet networks
93	   often encounter similar problems of interpretation, such as with the
94	   adjective phrases "in-band" and "out-of-band" (Section 2).  This
95	   document considers some common qualifiers and modifiers that are
96	   prepended to the OAM abbreviation, and lays out guidelines for their
97	   use in future IETF work to achieve consistent and unambiguous
98	   characterization (Section 3).  While this document introduces new
99	   terminology, it is does not update or change the meaning of
100	   terminology found in existing RFCs.

102	2.  In-Band and Out-of-Band OAM

104	   Historically, the terms "in-band" and "out-of-band" were used
105	   extensively in radio communications as well as in telephony signaling
106	   [RFC4733].  In both these cases, there is an actual "Band" (i.e., a
107	   "Channel" or "Frequency") to be within or outside.

109	   While those terms, useful in their simplicity, continued to be
110	   broadly used to mean "within something" and "outside something", a
111	   challenge is presented for IP communications and packet-switched
112	   networks (PSNs) which do not have a "band" per se, and, in fact, have
113	   multiple "somethings" that OAM traffic can be carried within or
114	   outside.  A frequently encountered case is the use of "in-band" to
115	   mean either In-Data-Packet or on-path.

117	   There are many examples of "in-band OAM" and "out-of-band OAM" in
118	   published RFCs.  For instance, the term "in-band" appears in both
119	   Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV) [RFC5085] and OAM
120	   for Deterministic Networking (DetNet) [RFC9551].  While the context
121	   in each of these documents is clear, the term carries different
122	   meanings in each case.  These two examples, as well as other examples
123	   of uses of the term "in-band" in other documents are described in
124	   Appendix A.

126	   Generally speaking, within the IETF, the terms "in-band" and "out-of-
127	   band" cannot be reliably understood consistently and unambiguously.
128	   Context-specific definitions of these terms are inconsistent and
129	   therefore cannot be generalized.  More importantly, the terms are not
130	   self-defining to any further extent and cannot be understood by
131	   someone exposed to them for the first time, since there is no "band"
132	   in IP.

134	   While interpreting existing documents, it is important to understand
135	   the semantics of what the term "band" refers to, and to be more
136	   explicit if those documents are updated.  This document does not
137	   change the meaning of any terms in any prior RFCs.

139	3.  Terminology and Guidance
140	3.1.  Recommendation

142	   This document recommends avoiding the terms "in-band" and "out-of-
143	   band" when referring to OAM.  Instead, it encourages the use of more
144	   fine-grained and descriptive terminology.  The document also presents
145	   alternative terms and definitions for use in future IETF documents
146	   referencing OAM, without precluding the use of other precise,
147	   descriptive terms that do not rely on the "-band" convention.

149	   The terminology presented in this section classifies OAM according to
150	   three criteria: whether it operates in an active, passive, or hybrid
151	   mode (Section 3.2); whether it follows the same path as data traffic
152	   (Section 3.3); and whether it receives the same treatment as data
153	   traffic (Section 3.4).

155	3.2.  Active, Passive, and Hybrid OAM

157	   [RFC7799] provides clear definitions for active and passive
158	   performance assessment, enabling the construction of metrics and
159	   methods to be described as either "Active" or "Passive".  Even though
160	   [RFC7799] does not explicitly use these terms as modifiers of "OAM",
161	   they are widely used in practice and are included here for clarity.
162	   The terms "Active", "Passive" and "Hybrid", as described below, are
163	   consistent with [RFC7799].  This document does not update or change
164	   the terms of [RFC7799].

166	   Active OAM:
167	      Uses dedicated OAM packets.

169	   Passive OAM:
170	      Relies on the observation of one or more existing data packet
171	      streams and does not use dedicated OAM packets and does not modify
172	      data packets.

174	   Hybrid OAM:
175	      Uses a combination of Active Methods and Passive Methods, which
176	      may include augmentation or modification of the stream of
177	      interest.  [RFC7799] makes a distinction between Hybrid Type I,
178	      referring to a single stream of interest, and Hybrid Type II,
179	      referring to two or more streams of interest.

181	   This document defines the term In-Data-Packet OAM as a more specific
182	   and narrowly scoped instance within the broader category of Hybrid
183	   OAM.  This new term allows for a more fine-grained classification of
184	   OAM mechanisms, as the broad category of Hybrid OAM includes a
185	   diverse set of possible OAM methods.

187	   In-Data-Packet OAM:

189	      OAM-related information is carried in the packets that also carry
190	      the data traffic.  This is a specific case of Hybrid OAM.  It was
191	      sometimes referred to as "in-band".

193	   Note that In-Data-Packet OAM is a specific case of Hybrid Type I, as
194	   it is applied to a single stream of interest.

196	   The following examples illustrate the terms Active, Passive, Hybrid,
197	   and In-Data-Packet OAM:

199	   *  The MPLS echo request/reply messages [RFC8029] are an example of
200	      "Active OAM", since they are described as "An MPLS echo request/
201	      reply is a (possibly MPLS-labeled) IPv4 or IPv6 UDP packet".

203	   *  Monitoring a packet stream by maintaining counters for the packets
204	      within the stream is an example of "Passive OAM".

206	   *  An example of "Hybrid Type I OAM" that is also "In-Data-Packet
207	      OAM", is an IOAM (In Situ OAM) [RFC9197] trace option that is
208	      incorporated into data packets of a single stream of interest.
209	      According to [RFC9197], IOAM '...records OAM information within
210	      the packet while the packet traverses a particular network domain.
211	      The term "in situ" refers to the fact that the OAM data is added
212	      to the data packets rather than being sent within packets
213	      specifically dedicated to OAM.'

215	   *  Another example of "Hybrid Type I OAM" that is also "In-Data-
216	      Packet OAM" is Alternate Marking [RFC9341], when applied to data
217	      packets of a single stream.  In this case a small number of bits
218	      in the packet header is used for marking a subset of packets in a
219	      flow.

221	   *  An example of "Hybrid Type I OAM" which is not classified as "In-
222	      Data-Packet OAM" is Direct Loss Measurement [RFC6374], in which
223	      user packets are not modified by the protocol.  Instead, OAM
224	      packets are used for carrying information about observed network
225	      characteristics, namely user packet counter values, allowing for
226	      packet loss computation.

228	   *  Another example of "Hybrid Type I OAM" which is not "In-Data-
229	      Packet OAM" is the case where a packet stream is (actively)
230	      generated while an existing stream of interest is (passively)
231	      observed.  This example was introduced in [RFC7799] as a Hybrid
232	      Type I method.  Extending this example, if the packets of the
233	      active stream include an IOAM trace option, the method is
234	      characterized by the more general term, Hybrid Type I.

236	3.3.  Path Followed OAM

238	   Path-Congruent OAM:
239	      The OAM information follows the exact same forwarding path as the
240	      observed data traffic.

242	   Non-Path-Congruent OAM:
243	      The OAM information is not guaranteed to follow the exact same
244	      forwarding path as the observed data traffic.

246	   In this document, the term "path-congruent packets" describes packets
247	   that follow the exact same path (i.e., traverse the same nodes and
248	   links) within a network.  Note that this definition does not describe
249	   how the packets are treated in queues within the nodes on the path.

251	   An example of "Path-Congruent OAM" is the Virtual Circuit
252	   Connectivity Verification (VCCV) Type 1 (Section 5.1.1 of [RFC5085]),
253	   which was also referred to as In-Band VCCV.  The term "congruent"
254	   also appears in Section 2 of [RFC6669] in the context of path
255	   sharing.

257	3.4.  Packet Forwarding Treatment OAM

259	   Equal-Forwarding-Treatment OAM:
260	      The OAM packets receive the same forwarding (e.g., QoS) treatment
261	      as user data packets.

263	   Different-Forwarding-Treatment OAM:
264	      The OAM packets might receive different forwarding (e.g., QoS)
265	      treatment than user data packets.

267	   The motivation for Equal-Forwarding-Treatment OAM lies in the desire
268	   to ensure that OAM packets experience the same network conditions as
269	   the user data they are intended to monitor.  This includes not only
270	   traversing the same topological path but also receiving identical
271	   Quality of Service (QoS) treatment, such as queuing, scheduling, and
272	   traffic shaping.  When both topological and forwarding treatment
273	   equivalence are achieved, the OAM packets are said to exhibit fate-
274	   sharing [RFC7276] with the data traffic.  Fate-sharing ensures that
275	   any impairments or anomalies affecting the user traffic are also
276	   reflected in the behavior of the OAM packets, thereby making the
277	   results of the OAM observations more operationally meaningful and
278	   actionable.  Without such equivalence, discrepancies in treatment
279	   could lead to misleading measurements or diagnostics, and even
280	   inadequate corrective actions, reducing the utility of the OAM
281	   mechanism for performance monitoring, fault detection and mitigation.

283	   An example of "Equal-Forwarding-Treatment OAM" is presented in
284	   [RFC9551] in the context of Deterministic Networking (DetNet) OAM:
285	   "it traverses the same set of links and interfaces receiving the same
286	   QoS and Packet Replication, Elimination, and Ordering Functions
287	   (PREOF) treatment as the monitored DetNet flow".

289	3.5.  Using Multiple Criteria

291	   OAM protocols and tools can be classified according to the three
292	   criteria that were described in the previous sections.  However, not
293	   all criteria are applicable to all OAM protocols, and not all
294	   combinations are necessarily possible.  For example:

296	   *  Passive OAM relies solely on observing existing data traffic and
297	      does not generate dedicated OAM packets.  As such, the path
298	      congruence and forwarding treatment criteria are not relevant,
299	      since no dedicated OAM packets are exchanged between the
300	      measurement points.

302	   *  Non-Path-Congruent OAM, by nature, cannot be Equal-Forwarding-
303	      Treatment.

305	   When defining a new OAM mechanism or analyzing an existing one, it is
306	   recommended to explicitly consider which of these criteria are
307	   applicable and to describe the mechanism accordingly.  As a first
308	   step, all OAM mechanisms can be classified according to the first
309	   criterion, as Active, Passive, or Hybrid/In-Data-Packet.  Further
310	   classification according to the other two criteria should be
311	   considered on a case-by-case basis.

313	   A few examples of OAM classification according to the three criteria
314	   are presented below:

316	   *  IP Ping, which uses ICMP Echo messages, can be classified as
317	      Active OAM.  Since it is not guaranteed to follow the same path or
318	      receive the same treatment as user data packets, it is classified
319	      as Non-Path-Congruent and, consequently, as Different-Forwarding-
320	      Treatment.

322	   *  When an IOAM trace option [RFC9197] is incorporated in data
323	      packets it can be classified as In-Data-Packet, Path-Congruent and
324	      Equal-Forwarding-Treatment.

326	   *  VCCV [RFC5085], as discussed above, is classified as Active, Path-
327	      Congruent, and Different-Forwarding-Treatment.

329	   *  MPLS Inferred Loss Measurement (ILM) (Section 3 of [RFC6374]) uses
330	      specially generated test messages, and therefore can be classified
331	      as Active.  It is also Path-Congruent, and can be deployed either
332	      as Equal- or Different-Forwarding-Treatment OAM.  MPLS Direct Loss
333	      Measurement (DLM) (Section 3 of [RFC6374]) uses OAM messages that
334	      carry counters that count user data traffic.  Hence, it is
335	      classified as Hybrid Type I OAM, and as in the Inferred Loss
336	      Measurement, it is Path-Congruent, and can be either Equal- or
337	      Different-Forwarding-Treatment OAM.

339	   In measurement protocols, accurate results depend on path congruence
340	   and equal forwarding treatment.  In contrast, these properties are
341	   not always required in other OAM protocols.  For example,
342	   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) [RFC5880] control packets
343	   are often sent with the highest priority, which means they do not
344	   adhere to the equal forwarding treatment property.

346	   This multi-dimensional classification enables a more precise and
347	   consistent understanding of OAM mechanisms.

349	3.6.  Summary of Terms

351	   This section summarizes the terminology:

353	   Active OAM:
354	      Uses dedicated OAM packets.

356	   Passive OAM:
357	      Relies on the observation of one or more existing data packet
358	      streams and does not use dedicated OAM packets and does not modify
359	      data packets.

361	   Hybrid OAM:
362	      Uses a combination of Active Methods and Passive Methods, which
363	      may include augmentation or modification of the stream of
364	      interest.  [RFC7799] makes a distinction between Hybrid Type I,
365	      referring to a single stream of interest, and Hybrid Type II,
366	      referring to two or more streams of interest.

368	   In-Data-Packet OAM:
369	      OAM-related information is carried in the packets that also carry
370	      the data traffic.  This is a specific case of Hybrid OAM.  It was
371	      sometimes referred to as "in-band".

373	   Path-Congruent OAM:
374	      The OAM information follows the exact same forwarding path as the
375	      observed data traffic.

377	   Non-Path-Congruent OAM:
378	      The OAM information is not guaranteed to follow the exact same
379	      forwarding path as the observed data traffic.

381	   Equal-Forwarding-Treatment OAM:
382	      The OAM packets receive the same forwarding (e.g., QoS) treatment
383	      as user data packets.

385	   Different-Forwarding-Treatment OAM:
386	      The OAM packets might receive different forwarding (e.g., QoS)
387	      treatment than user data packets.

389	4.  Security Considerations

391	   Security is improved when terms are used with precision, and their
392	   definitions are unambiguous.

394	5.  IANA Considerations

396	   This document has no IANA actions.

501	Appendix A.  Examples of the Use of the Term In-Band

503	   This appendix provides a few examples of the use of the term "in-
504	   band".  These are intended to highlight the varying interpretations
505	   of the term across different contexts, which led to the guidelines in
506	   this document.

508	   In-Data-Packet OAM was in some cases referred to as "in-band".
509	   Initially, "In situ OAM" [RFC9197] was also referred to as "In-band
510	   OAM", but was renamed due to the overloaded meaning of "In-band OAM".
511	   Further, [RFC9232] also intertwines the terms "in-band" with "in
512	   situ".  Other similar uses, including [P4-INT-2.1], still use
513	   variations of "in-band", "in band", or "inband".

515	   Path-Congruent OAM was sometimes referred to as "in-band".  As
516	   described in [RFC5085], "The VCCV message travels in-band with the
517	   Session and follows the exact same path as the user data for the
518	   session".  The term "in-band" is also used in Section 2 of [RFC6669]
519	   with the same meaning.  Non-Path-Congruent OAM was referred to in
520	   [RFC5085] as Out-of-Band.

522	   The property of "Equal-Forwarding-Treatment" is referred to in
523	   [RFC9551] as "In-band OAM".  Similarly, the property of "Different-
524	   Forwarding-Treatment OAM" can be found in the following definition in
525	   [RFC9551]: "Out-of-band OAM: an active OAM method whose path through
526	   the DetNet domain may not be topologically identical to the path of
527	   the monitored DetNet flow, its test packets may receive different QoS
528	   and/or PREOF treatment, or both."  [I-D.ietf-raw-architecture] uses
529	   similar text.
