97	1.  Introduction

99	   The Stateless Hash-Based Digital Signature Algorithm (SLH-DSA) is a
100	   quantum-resistant digital signature scheme standardized in [FIPS205]
101	   by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) PQC
102	   project [NIST-PQC].  Prior to standardization, the algorithm was
103	   known as SPHINCS+. SLH-DSA and SPHINCS+ are not compatible.  This
104	   document defines the ASN.1 Object Identifiers (OIDs) and conventions
105	   for the encoding of SLH-DSA digital signatures, public keys and
106	   private keys in the X.509 Public Key Infrastructure.

108	   SLH-DSA offers three security levels.  The parameters for each of the
109	   security levels were chosen to be at least as secure as a generic
110	   block cipher of 128, 192, or 256 bits.  There are small (s) and fast
111	   (f) versions of the algorithm, and the option to use the SHA2
112	   algorithm family [FIPS180] or SHAKE256 [FIPS202] as internal
113	   functions.  While the fast versions are optimized for key generation
114	   and signing speed, they are actually slower at verification than the
115	   SLH-DSA small parameter sets.  For example, id-slh-dsa-shake-256s
116	   represents the 256-bit security level, the small version of the
117	   algorithm, and the use of SHAKE256.

119	   Separate algorithm identifiers have been assigned for SLH-DSA for
120	   each combination of these security levels, fast vs small, SHA2 vs
121	   SHAKE256 and pure mode vs pre-hash mode.

123	   SLH-DSA signature operations include as input an optional context
124	   string (ctx), defined in Section 10.2 of [FIPS205].  The context
125	   string has a maximum length of 255 bytes.  By default, the context
126	   string is the empty string.  This document only specifies the use of
127	   the empty context string for use in the X.509 Public Key
128	   Infrastructure.

130	   SLH-DSA offers two signature modes: pure mode, where the entire
131	   content is signed directly, and pre-hash mode, where a digest of the
132	   content is signed.  This document uses the term SLH-DSA to refer to
133	   the algorithm in general.  When a pure or pre-hash mode needs to be
134	   differentiated, the terms Pure SLH-DSA and HashSLH-DSA are used.
135	   This document specifies the use of both Pure SLH-DSA and HashSLH-DSA
136	   in Public Key Infrastructure X.509 (PKIX) certificates and
137	   Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).

139	2.  Conventions and Definitions

141	   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
142	   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
143	   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
144	   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
145	   capitals, as shown here.

147	3.  Algorithm Identifiers

149	   The AlgorithmIdentifier type is defined in [RFC5912] as follows:

151	   AlgorithmIdentifier{ALGORITHM-TYPE, ALGORITHM-TYPE:AlgorithmSet} ::=
152	           SEQUENCE {
153	               algorithm   ALGORITHM-TYPE.&id({AlgorithmSet}),
154	               parameters  ALGORITHM-TYPE.
155	                      &Params({AlgorithmSet}{@algorithm}) OPTIONAL
156	           }

158	      |  NOTE: The above syntax is from [RFC5912] and is compatible with
159	      |  the 2021 ASN.1 syntax [X680].  See [RFC5280] for the 1988 ASN.1
160	      |  syntax.

162	   The fields in AlgorithmIdentifier have the following meanings:

164	   *  algorithm identifies the cryptographic algorithm with an object
165	      identifier.

167	   *  parameters, which are optional, are the associated parameters for
168	      the algorithm identifier in the algorithm field.

170	   The object identifiers for SLH-DSA are defined in the NIST Computer
171	   Security Objects Register [CSOR], and are reproduced here for
172	   convenience.  The same algorithm identifiers are used for identifying
173	   a public key, a private key, and a signature.

175	   The Pure SLH-DSA OIDs are defined in
176	   [I-D.ietf-lamps-cms-sphincs-plus]'s ASN.1 module and reproduced here
177	   for convenience:

179	      nistAlgorithms OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { joint-iso-itu-t(2)
180	        country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101) csor(3) 4 }

186	      id-slh-dsa-sha2-128f OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { sigAlgs 21 }

188	      id-slh-dsa-sha2-192s OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { sigAlgs 22 }

202	      id-slh-dsa-shake-192f OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { sigAlgs 29 }

204	      id-slh-dsa-shake-256s OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { sigAlgs 30 }

206	      id-slh-dsa-shake-256f OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { sigAlgs 31 }

208	   The HashSLH-DSA OIDs are:

210	      nistAlgorithms OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { joint-iso-itu-t(2)
211	        country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101) csor(3) 4 }

213	      sigAlgs OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { nistAlgorithms 3 }

215	      id-hash-slh-dsa-sha2-128s-with-sha256 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
216	         sigAlgs 35 }

218	      id-hash-slh-dsa-sha2-128f-with-sha256 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
219	         sigAlgs 36 }

221	      id-hash-slh-dsa-sha2-192s-with-sha512 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
222	         sigAlgs 37 }

224	      id-hash-slh-dsa-sha2-192f-with-sha512 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
225	         sigAlgs 38 }

227	      id-hash-slh-dsa-sha2-256s-with-sha512 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
228	         sigAlgs 39 }

230	      id-hash-slh-dsa-sha2-256f-with-sha512 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
231	         sigAlgs 40 }

233	      id-hash-slh-dsa-shake-128s-with-shake128 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
234	         sigAlgs 41 }

236	      id-hash-slh-dsa-shake-128f-with-shake128 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
237	         sigAlgs 42 }

239	      id-hash-slh-dsa-shake-192s-with-shake256 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
240	         sigAlgs 43 }

242	      id-hash-slh-dsa-shake-192f-with-shake256 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
243	         sigAlgs 44 }

245	      id-hash-slh-dsa-shake-256s-with-shake256 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
246	         sigAlgs 45 }

248	      id-hash-slh-dsa-shake-256f-with-shake256 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
249	         sigAlgs 46 }

251	   The contents of the parameters component for each algorithm MUST be
252	   absent.

254	4.  SLH-DSA Signatures

256	   SLH-DSA is a digital signature scheme built upon hash functions.  The
257	   security of SLH-DSA relies on the security properties of the
258	   underlying hash functions, such as the presumed difficulty of finding
259	   preimages.

261	   Signatures can be placed in a number of different ASN.1 structures.
262	   The top level structure for a certificate is given below as being
263	   illustrative of how signatures are frequently encoded with an
264	   algorithm identifier and a location for the signature.

266	     Certificate  ::=  SIGNED{ TBSCertificate }

268	     SIGNED{ToBeSigned} ::= SEQUENCE {
269	        toBeSigned           ToBeSigned,
270	        algorithmIdentifier  SEQUENCE {
271	            algorithm        SIGNATURE-ALGORITHM.
272	                               &id({SignatureAlgorithms}),
273	            parameters       SIGNATURE-ALGORITHM.
274	                               &Params({SignatureAlgorithms}
275	                                 {@algorithmIdentifier.algorithm})
276	                                   OPTIONAL
277	        },
278	        signature BIT STRING (CONTAINING SIGNATURE-ALGORITHM.&Value(
279	                                 {SignatureAlgorithms}
280	                                 {@algorithmIdentifier.algorithm}))
281	     }

283	      |  The above syntax is from [RFC5912] and is compatible with the
284	      |  2021 ASN.1 syntax [X680].  See [RFC5280] for the 1988 ASN.1
285	      |  syntax.

287	   The same algorithm identifiers are used for signatures as are used
288	   for public keys.  When used to identify signature algorithms, the
289	   parameters MUST be absent.

291	   The data to be signed is prepared for SLH-DSA.  Then, a private key
292	   operation is performed to generate the raw signature value.

294	   When signing data using the Pure SLH-DSA signature algorithm,
295	   Algorithm 22 (slh_sign) from Section 10.2.1 of [FIPS205] is used.
296	   When verifying Pure SLH-DSA signed data, Algorithm 24 (slh_verify)
297	   from Section 10.3 of [FIPS205] is used.  When signing data using the
298	   HashSLH-DSA signature algorithm, Algorithm 23 (hash_slh_sign) from
299	   Section 10.2.2 of [FIPS205] is used.  When verifying HashSLH-DSA
300	   signed data, Algorithm 25 (hash_slh_verify) from Section 10.3 of
301	   [FIPS205] is used.  All four of these algorithms create a message,
302	   M', from the message to be signed along with other data, and M' is
303	   operated on by internal SLH-DSA algorithms.  M' may be constructed
304	   outside the module that performs the internal SLH-DSA algorithms.

306	   In the case of HashSLH-DSA, there is a pre-hash component (PH_M) of
307	   M'.  PH_M may be computed in the signing/verifying module, in which
308	   case the entire message to be signed is sent to the module.
309	   Alternatively, PH_M may be computed in a different module.  In this
310	   case, either PH_M is sent to the signing/verifying module, which
311	   creates M', or M' is created outside the signing/verifying module and
312	   is sent to the module.  HashSLH-DSA allows this implementation
313	   flexibility in order to reduce, and make consistent, the amount of
314	   data transferred to signing/verifying modules.  The hash algorithm or
315	   XOF used to generate the pre-hash when signing and verifying with
316	   HashSLH-DSA is specified after the "-with-" component of the
317	   signature algorithm name.  For example, when signing with id-hash-
318	   slh-dsa-sha2-128s-with-sha256, SHA-256 is used as the pre-hash
319	   algorithm.  When pre-hashing is performed using SHAKE128, the output
320	   length is 256 bits.  When pre-hashing is performed using SHAKE256,
321	   the output length is 512 bits.

323	   Section 9.2 of [FIPS205] defines an SLH-DSA signature as three
324	   elements, R, SIG_FORS and SIG_HT.  The raw octet string encoding of
325	   an SLH-DSA signature is the concatenation of these three elements,
326	   i.e. R || SIG_FORS || SIG_HT.  The raw octet string representing the
327	   signature is encoded directly in the BIT STRING without adding any
328	   additional ASN.1 wrapping.  For example, in the Certificate
329	   structure, the raw signature value is encoded in the "signature" BIT
330	   STRING field.

332	5.  Subject Public Key Fields

334	   In the X.509 certificate, the subjectPublicKeyInfo field has the
335	   SubjectPublicKeyInfo type, which has the following ASN.1 syntax:

337	     SubjectPublicKeyInfo {PUBLIC-KEY: IOSet} ::= SEQUENCE {
338	         algorithm        AlgorithmIdentifier {PUBLIC-KEY, {IOSet}},
339	         subjectPublicKey BIT STRING }

341	      |  The above syntax is from [RFC5912] and is compatible with the
342	      |  2021 ASN.1 syntax [X680].  See [RFC5280] for the 1988 ASN.1
343	      |  syntax.

345	   The fields in SubjectPublicKeyInfo have the following meanings:

347	   *  algorithm is the algorithm identifier and parameters for the
348	      public key (see above).

350	   *  subjectPublicKey contains the byte stream of the public key.

352	   [I-D.ietf-lamps-cms-sphincs-plus] defines the following public key
353	   identifiers for Pure SLH-DSA:

355	      pk-slh-dsa-sha2-128s PUBLIC-KEY ::= {
356	         IDENTIFIER id-slh-dsa-sha2-128s
357	         -- KEY no ASN.1 wrapping --
358	         CERT-KEY-USAGE
359	            { digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyCertSign, cRLSign }
360	         -- PRIVATE-KEY no ASN.1 wrapping -- }

362	      pk-slh-dsa-sha2-128f PUBLIC-KEY ::= {
363	         IDENTIFIER id-slh-dsa-sha2-128f

529	   Section 9.1 of [FIPS205] defines an SLH-DSA public key as two n-byte
530	   elements, PK.seed and PK.root.  The raw octet string encoding of an
531	   SLH-DSA public key is the concatenation of these two elements, i.e.
532	   PK.seed || PK.root.  The octet string length is 2*n bytes, where n is
533	   16, 24, or 32, depending on the SLH-DSA parameter set.  When used in
534	   a SubjectPublicKeyInfo type, the subjectPublicKey BIT STRING contains
535	   the raw octet string encoding of the public key.

537	   [I-D.ietf-lamps-cms-sphincs-plus] defines the SLH-DSA-PublicKey and
538	   SLH-DSA-PrivateKey ASN.1 OCTET STRING types to provide an option for
539	   encoding a Pure SLH-DSA public or private key in an environment that
540	   uses ASN.1 encoding but doesn't define its own mapping of an SLH-DSA
541	   raw octet string to ASN.1.  HashSLH-DSA public and private keys can
542	   use SLH-DSA-PublicKey and SLH-DSA-PrivateKey in the same way.  To map
543	   an SLH-DSA-PublicKey OCTET STRING to a SubjectPublicKeyInfo, the
544	   OCTET STRING is mapped to the subjectPublicKey field (a value of type
545	   BIT STRING) as follows: the most significant bit of the OCTET STRING
546	   value becomes the most significant bit of the BIT STRING value, and
547	   so on; the least significant bit of the OCTET STRING becomes the
548	   least significant bit of the BIT STRING.

550	   The AlgorithmIdentifier for an SLH-DSA public key MUST use one of the
551	   id-slh-dsa-* or id-hash-slh-dsa-* object identifiers from Section 3.
552	   The parameters field of the AlgorithmIdentifier for the SLH-DSA
553	   public key MUST be absent.

555	   Appendix C.1 contains an example of an id-slh-dsa-sha2-128s public
556	   key encoded using the textual encoding defined in [RFC7468].

558	6.  Key Usage Bits

560	   The intended application for the key is indicated in the keyUsage
561	   certificate extension; see Section 4.2.1.3 of [RFC5280].  If the
562	   keyUsage extension is present in a certificate that indicates an id-
563	   slh-dsa-* (Pure SLH-DSA) or id-hash-slh-dsa-* (HashSLH-DSA)
564	   identifier in the SubjectPublicKeyInfo, then at least one of the
565	   following MUST be present:

567	       digitalSignature; or
568	       nonRepudiation; or
569	       keyCertSign; or
570	       cRLSign.

572	   If the keyUsage extension is present in a certificate that indicates
573	   an id-slh-dsa-* (Pure SLH-DSA) or id-hash-slh-dsa-* (HashSLH-DSA)
574	   identifier in the SubjectPublicKeyInfo, then the following MUST NOT
575	   be present:

577	       keyEncipherment; or
578	       dataEncipherment; or
579	       keyAgreement; or
580	       encipherOnly; or
581	       decipherOnly.

583	   Requirements about the keyUsage extension bits defined in [RFC5280]
584	   still apply.

586	7.  Private Key Format

588	   "Asymmetric Key Packages" [RFC5958] describes how to encode a private
589	   key in a structure that both identifies what algorithm the private
590	   key is for and optionally allows for the public key and additional
591	   attributes about the key to be included as well.  For illustration,
592	   the ASN.1 structure OneAsymmetricKey is replicated below.

594	      OneAsymmetricKey ::= SEQUENCE {
595	         version Version,
596	         privateKeyAlgorithm PrivateKeyAlgorithmIdentifier,
597	         privateKey PrivateKey,
598	         attributes [0] IMPLICIT Attributes OPTIONAL,
599	         ...,
600	         [[2: publicKey [1] IMPLICIT PublicKey OPTIONAL ]],
601	         ...
602	      }

604	      PrivateKey ::= OCTET STRING

606	      PublicKey ::= BIT STRING

608	      |  The above syntax is from [RFC5958] and is compatible with the
609	      |  2021 ASN.1 syntax [X680].

611	   Section 9.1 of [FIPS205] defines an SLH-DSA private key as four
612	   n-byte elements, SK.seed, SK.prf, PK.seed and PK.root.  The raw octet
613	   string encoding of an SLH-DSA private key is the concatenation of
614	   these four elements, i.e. SK.seed || SK.prf || PK.seed || PK.root.
615	   The octet string length is 4*n bytes, where n is 16, 24, or 32,
616	   depending on the SLH-DSA parameter set.  When used in a
617	   OneAsymmetricKey type, the privateKey OCTET STRING contains the raw
618	   octet string encoding of the private key.

620	   When an SLH-DSA public key is included in a OneAsymmetricKey type, it
621	   is encoded in the same manner as in a SubjectPublicKeyInfo type.
622	   That is, the publicKey BIT STRING contains the raw octet string
623	   encoding of the public key.

625	   Appendix C.2 contains an example of an id-slh-dsa-sha2-128s private
626	   key encoded using the textual encoding defined in [RFC7468].

628	   NOTE: There exist some private key import functions that have not
629	   picked up the new ASN.1 structure OneAsymmetricKey that is defined in
630	   [RFC5958].  This means that they will not accept a private key
631	   structure that contains the public key field.  This means a balancing
632	   act needs to be done between being able to do a consistency check on
633	   the key pair and widest ability to import the key.

635	8.  Operational Considerations

637	   SLH-DSA uses the same OID to identify a public key and a signature
638	   algorithm.  The implication of this is that, despite being
639	   mathematically possible, an SLH-DSA key identified by a Pure SLH-DSA
640	   OID is not permitted to be used to generate or verify a signature
641	   identified by an HashSLH-DSA OID, and vice-versa.

643	   CA operators will need to decide in advance whether their CA
644	   certificates will use Pure SLH-DSA or HashSLH-DSA and assign the
645	   appropriate OID to the public and private keys when generating their
646	   certificate.  Some of the following considerations may affect this
647	   decision.

649	   *  When using an external signing module, such as an HSM, the size of
650	      data that can be transferred to and processed by the signature
651	      module may be limited.  SLH-DSA performs two passes on the
652	      internal M' message, so it must be held in memory.  Using HashSLH-
653	      DSA reduces the size of M'.

655	   *  Large CRLs might also exceed the size limits of HSM signing
656	      operations when using Pure SLH-DSA.  One way to limit the size of
657	      CRLs is to make use of CRL Distribution Points and Issuing
658	      Distribution Points to create partitioned CRLs in accordance with
659	      Section 5.2.5 of [RFC5280].

661	   *  EE certificates with many SANs might also exceed the size limits
662	      of HSM signing operations.

664	   *  Potential verifiers' environments might need to be considered.
665	      The entire certificate or CRL needs to be held in memory during
666	      SLH-DSA signature verification, it cannot be streamed.  In
667	      particular, there is a randomizer (R) which is extracted from the
668	      SLH-DSA signature and fed to a digest function before M' is.
669	      Thus, to stream a message for SLH-DSA verification the signature
670	      must come before the message.  This is not the case for
671	      certificates and CRLs.  Using HashSLH-DSA reduces the size of the
672	      M' being held in memory.

674	9.  Security Considerations

676	   The security considerations of [RFC5280] apply accordingly.
677	   Moreover, the security aspects mentioned throughout [FIPS205] should
678	   be taken into account; see for instance Sections 3.1 and 3.2 or the
679	   beginning of Section 11.

681	   The security of SLH-DSA relies on the security properties of the
682	   internal hash and XOF functions.  In particular, it relies on these
683	   functions being preimage resistant, but it does not rely on them
684	   being collision resistant.  Since HashSLH-DSA performs a pre-hash
685	   before signing, it relies on both preimage resistance and collision
686	   resistance of the pre-hash function.  In order to achieve an
687	   appropriate level of collision resistance, the output length of the
688	   pre-hash functions used for HashSLH-DSA is twice the length of the
689	   internal hash and XOF functions.

691	   Implementations MUST protect the private keys.  Compromise of the
692	   private keys may result in the ability to forge signatures.

694	   When generating an SLH-DSA key pair, an implementation MUST generate
695	   each key pair independently of all other key pairs in the SLH-DSA
696	   hypertree.

698	   An SLH-DSA tree MUST NOT be used for more than 2^64 signing
699	   operations.

701	   The generation of private keys relies on random numbers.  The use of
702	   inadequate pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) to generate these
703	   values can result in little or no security.  An attacker may find it
704	   much easier to reproduce the PRNG environment that produced the keys,
705	   searching the resulting small set of possibilities, rather than brute
706	   force searching the whole key space.  The generation of quality
707	   random numbers is difficult, and [RFC4086] offers important guidance
708	   in this area.

710	   Implementers SHOULD consider their particular use cases and may
711	   choose to implement OPTIONAL fault attack countermeasures
712	   [CMP2018],[Ge2023].  Verifying a signature before releasing the
713	   signature value is a typical fault attack countermeasure; however,
714	   this countermeasure is not effective for SLH-DSA [Ge2023].
715	   Redundancy by replicating the signature generation process can be
716	   used as an effective fault attack countermeasure for SLH-DSA
717	   [Ge2023]; however, the SLH-DSA signature generation is already
718	   considered slow.

720	   Likewise, implementers SHOULD consider their particular use cases and
721	   may choose to implement protections against passive power and
722	   emissions side-channel attacks [SLotH].

724	10.  IANA Considerations

726	   For the ASN.1 Module in Appendix A of this document, IANA is
727	   requested to assign an object identifier (OID) for the module
728	   identifier (TBD1) with a Description of "id-mod-x509-slh-dsa-2024".
729	   The OID for the module should be allocated in the "SMI Security for
730	   PKIX Module Identifier" registry (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.0).

1208	Appendix B.  Security Strengths

1210	   Instead of defining the strength of a quantum algorithm in a
1211	   traditional manner using precise estimates of the number of bits of
1212	   security, NIST defined a collection of broad security strength
1213	   categories.  Each category is defined by a comparatively easy-to-
1214	   analyze reference primitive that cover a range of security strengths
1215	   offered by existing NIST standards in symmetric cryptography, which
1216	   NIST expects to offer significant resistance to quantum
1217	   cryptanalysis.  These categories describe any attack that breaks the
1218	   relevant security definition that must require computational
1219	   resources comparable to or greater than those required for: Level 1 -
1220	   key search on a block cipher with a 128-bit key (e.g., AES128), Level
1221	   2 - collision search on a 256-bit hash function (e.g., SHA256/
1222	   SHA3-256), Level 3 - key search on a block cipher with a 192-bit key
1223	   (e.g., AES192), Level 4 - collision search on a 384-bit hash function
1224	   (e.g.  SHA384/SHA3-384), Level 5 - key search on a block cipher with
1225	   a 256-bit key (e.g., AES 256).

1227	   The SLH-DSA parameter sets defined for NIST security levels 1, 3 and
1228	   5 are listed in Table 1, along with the resulting signature size,
1229	   public key, and private key sizes in bytes.  The HashSLH-DSA
1230	   parameter sets have the same values as the Pure SLH-DSA equivalents.
