7	            YANG-CBOR: Allocating SID ranges for PEN holders
8	                    draft-ietf-core-yang-sid-pen-04

10	Abstract

12	   YANG-CBOR (RFC 9254) defines YANG Schema Item iDentifiers (YANG SID),
13	   globally unique 63-bit unsigned integers used to identify YANG items.
14	   RFC 9595 defines ways to allocate these SIDs on the basis of IANA
15	   registries.

17	   The present specification employs these SID allocation mechanisms to
18	   allocate ranges with 100 000 63-bit SIDs each for each of the first
19	   1 000 000 holders of IANA-registered Private Enterprise Numbers
20	   (PENs), as well as ranges with 10 000 32-bit SIDs each for each of
21	   the first 100 000 holders.

23	   // The present revision –04 is intended to address the feedback from
24	   // the AD review and the IETF last call.  Note that due to a
25	   // regression in the bib.ietf.org service (https://github.com/ietf-
26	   // tools/bibxml-service/issues/489 (https://github.com/ietf-tools/
27	   // bibxml-service/issues/489)), the reference
28	   // [IANA.enterprise-numbers] may come out as "*** BROKEN REFERENCE
29	   // ***" in some CI systems; this will certainly be fixed in the
30	   // course of further processing.

91	1.  Introduction

93	   YANG-CBOR [RFC9254] defines YANG Schema Item iDentifiers (YANG SID),
94	   globally unique 63-bit unsigned integers used to identify YANG items.
95	   [RFC9595] defines ways to allocate these SIDs on the basis of IANA
96	   registries.

98	   The present specification employs these SID allocation mechanisms to
99	   allocate ranges with 100 000 63-bit SIDs each for each of the first
100	   1 000 000 holders of IANA-registered Private Enterprise Numbers
101	   (PENs), as well as ranges with 10 000 32-bit SIDs each for each of
102	   the first 100 000 holders.

104	   IANA [is requested to allocate/has allocated] a mega-range with
105	   100 billion 63-bit SIDs, for the SID numbers 300 000 000 000 to
106	   399 999 999 999.

108	   IANA also [is requested to allocate/has allocated] a mega-range with
109	   1 billion 32-bit SIDs, for the SID numbers 3 000 000 000 to
110	   3 999 999 999.

112	   Private Enterprise Numbers (PENs) are registered in
113	   [IANA.enterprise-numbers] in a low-threshold, low-overhead
114	   registration process.  At the time of writing (~ 37 years after
115	   creating this registry), around 65 000 PENs are registered.  In this
116	   document, the registrant for a PEN is referred to as the "PEN
117	   holder".

119	   The present specification makes the following SID ranges available to
120	   certain (current or future) PEN holders for allocation in a scheme
121	   defined by the holder:

123	   *  The holder of a PEN ppp ppp (< 1 000 000) can use the SID numbers
124	      3pp ppp p00 000 to 3pp ppp p99 999.

126	   *  The holder of a PEN pp ppp (< 100 000) can use the SID numbers
127	      3 ppp pp0 000 to 3 ppp pp9 999.

129	2.  Example

131	   The Department for Mathematics and Computer Science of Universität
132	   Bremen holds PEN 30810.

134	   To this PEN holder, the present specification confers control over
135	   the SID ranges:

137	   *  3*03 081 0*00 000 up to 3*03 081 0*99 999, and
138	   *  3 *308 10*0 000 up to 3 *308 10*9 999.

140	   (The plaintext form of this document shows "*" characters around the
141	   digits conveying the PEN, which are shown in *boldface* in the
142	   typographic forms.)

144	3.  Discussion

146	   This allocation provides an extremely-low-threshold (zero-
147	   interaction) way for PEN holders to get number space for the YANG
148	   SIDs used in their YANG modules.  If a PEN is not already available
149	   to the entity needing such number space, it can be obtained in a very
150	   low-threshold process.  Employing this number space is, however, not
151	   always the approach to recommend to a module author:

153	   *  The larger of the two spaces uses 64-bit numbers.  The larger
154	      representation size of the absolute value of the SID is of
155	      comparatively little consequence due to the delta-encoding used
156	      for SIDs in YANG-CBOR.

158	   *  For the first 100 000 PEN holders, there also is a smaller space
159	      that uses 32-bit numbers.  PEN numbers that have access to this
160	      space are likely to run out before or around 2040; the expectation
161	      is that by that time there will be enough opportunities to request
162	      SID ranges within mega-ranges allocated by other registrants that
163	      this mechanism is less needed.

165	   *  This space has no infrastructure to discover the YANG module
166	      behind a SID.  Of course, each PEN holder can provide such
167	      infrastructure, but even then the problem remains of how to find
168	      that infrastructure for a SID.  (Search engines may mitigate this
169	      somewhat.)  On the other hand, in some cases this relative
170	      obscurity may be exactly what a PEN holder wants to achieve by
171	      using this mechanism.

173	      If obscurity is not the intention, one or both of the following
174	      approaches are encouraged:

176	      -  The PEN holder can provide a public repository where their YANG
177	         models can be found alongside the applicable SID files.  Such a
178	         repository may be easy to set up using a popular git forge such
179	         as, at the time of writing, GitHub.

181	      -  Implementations that employ PEN-based SIDs can facilitate
182	         information discovery by providing [I-D.ietf-core-yang-library]
183	         or another form of YANG library [RFC8525].

185	   Relying on the PEN registry might theoretically trigger a land-grab
186	   by prospective writers of YANG modules.  However, PENs have been
187	   around for decades (see Section 3.1.4 of [RFC1065], which continues
188	   to be in force with no technical changes as Section 3.1.4 of RFC 1155
189	   [STD16]), and such a land-grab has not occurred for the other
190	   allocations implicitly provided by obtaining a PEN.

192	4.  IANA Considerations

194	   // RFC Ed.: throughout this section, please replace RFC-XXXX with the
195	   // RFC number of this specification and remove this note.

197	   As per Section 6.3 of [RFC9595], in the YANG-SID Mega-Ranges registry
198	   within the YANG SIDs registry group, this document allocates two
199	   mega-ranges, one with 1 billion SIDs ranging from 3 000 000 000 up to
200	   3 999 999 999 (32-bit representation size), and one with 100 billion
201	   SIDs ranging from 300 000 000 000 up to 399 999 999 999 (64-bit
202	   representation size), as summarized in Table 1.

217	     Table 1: YANG-SID Mega-Range Allocations for use by PEN holders

219	   An additional contact for the allocation is: IETF CORE Working Group
220	   (core@ietf.org) or IETF Applications and Real-Time Area
221	   (art@ietf.org).

223	   The allocation policy inside the mega-range is "private".  The URL is
224	   that of the present specification.

226	   The management of the SID block of 100 000 SIDs each, ranging from
227	   3pp ppp p00 000 to 3pp ppp p99 999, is delegated to the PEN holder
228	   for PEN ppp ppp (i.e., the PEN holder for ppp ppp controls SID
229	   3pp ppp p00 000 to 3pp ppp p99 999).

231	   Similarly, the management of the SID block of 10 000 SIDs each,
232	   ranging from 3 ppp pp0 000 to 3 ppp pp9 999, is delegated to the PEN
233	   holder for PEN pp ppp (i.e., the PEN holder for pp ppp controls SID
234	   3 ppp pp0 000 to 3 ppp pp9 999).

236	   Section 6.3.2 of [RFC9595] requires an organization that requests an
237	   entry in the "YANG-SID Mega-Ranges" registry to ensure the technical
238	   capacity to manage the SID ranges within those mega-ranges for a
239	   period of at least 10 years (Private ranges).  The individual SID
240	   ranges within the mega-ranges allocated in this document are assigned
241	   through the registration of PEN numbers.  The technical capacity to
242	   ensure the sustained operation of the PEN number registry is derived
243	   from the demonstrated capacity of IANA to maintain this registry as
244	   well as the importance of a functioning PEN number registry in other
245	   contexts.

247	5.  Security Considerations

249	   Section 5 (Security Considerations) of [RFC9595] applies, as well as
250	   Section 8 (Security Considerations) of [RFC9254].  In particular, the
251	   fact that a certain Private Enterprise Number appears in a SID is not
252	   an indicator of provenance, i.e., it does not guarantee that the SID
253	   or underlying YANG model actually does originate from the holder of
254	   that PEN.  The requirement to ascertain the authoritative source of
255	   this information, as discussed in the above security considerations,
256	   remains.
