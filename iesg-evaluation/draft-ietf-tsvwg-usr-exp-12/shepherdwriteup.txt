-- Document History

1. Does the working group (WG) consensus represent the strong concurrence of a
few individuals, with others being silent, or did it reach broad agreement?

The Transport Area WG (tsvwg) is a collection of people with varied
interests that don't individually justify their own working groups.

This draft is supported by the portion of the tsvwg working group that
is familiar with and is interested in transport protocol ports and port
assignments.  The draft has received significant review and critique from
a number of port assignment experts, including two very experienced reviewers
of port requests (one of whom is the draft author).

2. Was there controversy about particular points, or were there decisions where
the consensus was particularly rough?

No controversy.  During WGLC, there was discussion that confirmed the utility
of using a port for experimentation without recording an assignment
for that port (e.g., using a port for assigned academic coursework).
In addition, several minor concerns were raised during WGLC (e.g., STUN/TURN
interaction and whether to include DCCP), all of which have been resolved.

3. Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If
so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the
responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this
questionnaire is publicly available.)

No.

4. For protocol documents, are there existing implementations of the contents of
the document? Have a significant number of potential implementers indicated
plans to implement? Are any existing implementations reported somewhere,
either in the document itself (as <a href="/doc/rfc7942/">RFC 7942</a> recommends) or elsewhere
(where)?

Implementation is not feasible without the IANA actions specified by this document.

-- Additional Reviews

5. Do the contents of this document closely interact with technologies in other
IETF working groups or external organizations, and would it therefore benefit
from their review? Have those reviews occurred? If yes, describe which
reviews took place.

This document closely interacts with the transport protocols that use ports.
The shepherd is confident that TSVWG members with expertise in those protocols
have provided sufficient review, e.g., for SCTP and DCCP in addition to TCP
and UDP.

6. Describe how the document meets any required formal expert review criteria,
such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.

n/a

7. If the document contains a YANG module, has the final version of the module
been checked with any of the recommended validation tools for syntax and
formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is
the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module
comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified
in <a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC 8342</a>?

8. Describe reviews and automated checks performed to validate sections of the
final version of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code,
BNF rules, MIB definitions, CBOR's CDDL, etc.

-- Document Shepherd Checks

9. Based on the shepherd's review of the document, is it their opinion that this
document is needed, clearly written, complete, correctly designed, and ready
to be handed off to the responsible Area Director?

Yes.

10. Several IETF Areas have assembled lists of common issues that their
reviewers encounter. For which areas have such issues been identified
and addressed? For which does this still need to happen in subsequent
reviews?

This document has not been reviewed against any common issues list.

11. What type of RFC publication is being requested on the IETF stream (Best
Current Practice, Proposed Standard, Internet Standard,
Informational, Experimental or Historic)? Why is this the proper type
of RFC? Do all Datatracker state attributes correctly reflect this intent?

Proposed Standard.  This is necessary to specify the use of the ports
that this document allocates for experimentation.  The Datatracker reflects
this decision.

12. Have reasonable efforts been made to remind all authors of the intellectual
property rights (IPR) disclosure obligations described in <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a>? To
the best of your knowledge, have all required disclosures been filed? If
not, explain why. If yes, summarize any relevant discussion, including links
to publicly-available messages when applicable.

Yes, the author has stated that there are no required disclosures.

13. Has each author, editor, and contributor shown their willingness to be
listed as such? If the total number of authors and editors on the front page
is greater than five, please provide a justification.

Yes.

14. Document any remaining I-D nits in this document. Simply running the idnits
tool is not enough; please review the "Content Guidelines" on
<a href="http://authors.ietf.org">authors.ietf.org</a>. (Also note that the current idnits tool generates
some incorrect warnings; a rewrite is underway.)

No remaining I-D nits in -10.

Privacy considerations are briefly discussed in the second paragraph of section
7 (Security Considerations), with an appropriate reference to <a href="/doc/rfc6973/">RFC 6973</a>.  The
limited scope of this draft does not merit a separate Privacy Considerations section.

15. Should any informative references be normative or vice-versa? See the IESG
Statement on Normative and Informative References.

Checks by the shepherd resulted in one reference classification change in each
direction (N -&gt; I, I -&gt; N) and removal of a duplicate reference.  The shepherd is
satisfied with the current reference classifications.

16. List any normative references that are not freely available to anyone. Did
the community have sufficient access to review any such normative
references?

No normative references that are not freely available to anyone.

17. Are there any normative downward references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a> and <a href="/doc/bcp97/">BCP
97</a>) that are not already listed in the DOWNREF registry? If so,
list them.

No normative downward references.

18. Are there normative references to documents that are not ready to be
submitted to the IESG for publication or are otherwise in an unclear state?
If so, what is the plan for their completion?

No normative references to Internet-Drafts.

19. Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? If
so, does the Datatracker metadata correctly reflect this and are those RFCs
listed on the title page, in the abstract, and discussed in the
introduction? If not, explain why and point to the part of the document
where the relationship of this document to these other RFCs is discussed.

No status changes.  This document updates <a href="/doc/rfc4727/">RFC 4727</a> - that update action is
noted in the first page header of this document and described at the end
of section 1.

20. Describe the document shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section,
especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document.
Confirm that all aspects of the document requiring IANA assignments are
associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm
that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm
that each newly created IANA registry specifies its initial contents,
allocations procedures, and a reasonable name (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>).

The transport port and service name assignments made by this document are
well-documented.  The primary author of this document is extraordinarily
familiar with IANA's procedures for handling such assignments.

The request to allocate an SCTP PPID is sufficiently documented.

The new PExID registry is documented by reference to the TCP option ID
registry.  That should suffice to convey the structure to IANA.  This
new registry is explicitly documented as having no initial contents.

21. List any new IANA registries that require Designated Expert Review for
future allocations. Are the instructions to the Designated Expert clear?
Please include suggestions of designated experts, if appropriate.

None - the new IANA registry for PExIDs that is created by this document
uses a First Come, First Served (FCFS) allocation policy.
