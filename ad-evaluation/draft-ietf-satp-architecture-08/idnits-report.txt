88	1.  Introduction

90	   This document proposes an interoperability architecture based on
91	   gateways, which are points of interconnection between networks or
92	   systems.

94	   There are several services that may be offered by a gateway, one of
95	   which being the direct transfer of a digital asset from one network
96	   to another via pairs of gateways without a mediating third party.

98	   A given network or system may have one or more gateways to perform a
99	   unidirectional direct transfer of digital assets to another network
100	   possessing one or more compatible gateway.

102	   The peer gateways must implement a secure asset transfer protocol
103	   that must satisfy certain security, privacy, atomicity and liveliness
104	   requirements.

106	   The purpose of this architecture document is to provide technical
107	   framework within which to define the required properties of a gateway
108	   that supports the secure asset transfer protocol.

110	2.  Terminology

112	   The current architecture specification borrows existing terminology
113	   from NIST [NIST and ISO [ISO].  New terms have been introduced
114	   notably in relation to the use of the gateways paradigm and
115	   commitment subprotocols.

117	   *  Asset network (system): The network or system where an asset is
118	      digitally represented (e.g., as a token).

120	   *  Asset Transfer Protocol: The protocol used to transfer (move) a
121	      digital asset from one network to another using gateways.

123	   *  Origin network: The current asset network where the digital asset
124	      is located.

126	   *  Destination network: The asset network to which a digital asset is
127	      to be transferred.

129	   *  Resource Domain: The collection of resources and entities
130	      participating within an asset network.  The domain denotes a
131	      boundary for permissible or authorized actions on resources.

133	   *  Interior Resources: The various interior protocols, data
134	      structures and cryptographic constructs that are a core part of an
135	      asset network or system.

137	   *  Exterior Resources: The various protocols, data structures and
138	      cryptographic constructs that are outside of (external to) the
139	      network or system.

141	   *  Gateway: The collection of services which connects to a minimum of
142	      one network or system, and which implements the secure asset
143	      transfer protocol.

145	   *  Entity public-key pair: This the private-public key pairs of an
146	      entity, where the public-key is available and verifiable outside
147	      the network.  Among others, it may be utilized for interactions
148	      with external entities (e.g. communications) located outside the
149	      network.  The term is used to distinguish this public-key other
150	      key-pairs belonging to the same entity, but which is only
151	      available within the (private) network.

153	   *  Originator: Person or organization in an origin network seeking
154	      the transfer of a digital asset to a beneficiary located in a
155	      remote network.

157	   *  Beneficiary: Person or organization in an destination network
158	      seeking to receive the transfer of a digital asset to from an
159	      originator located in a remote network.

161	   *  Gateway device identity: The identity of the device implementing
162	      the gateway functions.  The term is used in the sense of the DevID
163	      (IEEE 802.1AR) [DevID] or the EK/AIK keys (in TPM1.2 and TPM2.0)
164	      [TPMdevID].

166	   *  Gateway owner: The entity that owns and operates a gateway within
167	      a network.

169	   *  Application Context-ID: The relevant identifier used by
170	      originator's application and the beneficiary's application to
171	      identify the context of the asset transfer at the gateway level.
172	      The context identifier may also be used to bind the application to
173	      selected gateway for the given transfer instance, identified by a
174	      Session-ID.

176	   *  Gateway Session-ID: This is the identifier used between the sender
177	      gateway G1 and the recipient gateway G2 to identify the specific
178	      transfer instance between them.  The Session-ID must be included
179	      in all messages between the peer gateways.

181	3.  Assumptions and Principles

183	   The following assumptions and principles underlie the design of the
184	   current gateway architecture, and correspond to the design principles
185	   of the Internet architecture.

187	3.1.  Design Principles

189	   *  Opaque network resources: The interior resources of each network
190	      is assumed to be opaque to (hidden from) external entities.  Any
191	      resources to be made accessible to an external entity must be made
192	      explicitly accessible by a gateway with proper authorization.

194	   *  Externalization of value: The asset transfer protocol is agnostic
195	      (oblivious) to the economic or monetary value (if any) of the
196	      digital asset being transferred.

198	   The opaque resources principle permits the architecture to be applied
199	   in cases where one (or both) networks are private (closed
200	   membership).  It is the analog of the autonomous systems principle in
201	   IP networking [Clar88], where interior routes in local subnets are
202	   not visible to other external networks.

204	   The value-externalization principle permits an asset transfer
205	   protocol to be designed for efficiency, security and reliability --
206	   independent of the changes in the perceived economic value of the
207	   digital asset.  It is the analog of the end-to-end principle in the
208	   Internet architecture [SRC84], where contextual information is placed
209	   at the endpoints of the transfer.

211	3.2.  Operational Assumptions

213	   The following conditions are assumed to have occurred, leading to the
214	   invocation of the asset transfer protocol between two gateways:

216	   *  Application level context establishment: The transfer request from
217	      an Originator utilizing an application (App1) in the origin
218	      network is assumed to have occurred, and that some context-
219	      identifier has subsequently been derived by the respective
220	      applications (App1 and App2).  Furthermore, this context-
221	      identifier is assumed to have been delivered by the each
222	      application to its corresponding gateway, permitting each gateway
223	      to internally bind the transfer session-identifier to that
224	      context-identifier.

226	   *  Identification of asset to be transferred: The applications at the
227	      originator and the beneficiary are assumed to have identified the
228	      digital asset to be transferred.

230	   *  Identification of originator and beneficiary: The originator and
231	      beneficiary are assumed to have been identified and that consent
232	      has been obtained from both parties regarding the asset transfer.

234	   *  Identification of origin and destination asset networks: The
235	      origin and destination networks is assumed to have been
236	      identified.

238	   *  Selection of gateway: The two corresponding gateways at the origin
239	      and destination networks is assumed to have been identified and
240	      selected.

242	3.3.  Assumptions Regarding Gateway Operators

244	   The following conditions are assumed to have occurred, leading to the
245	   invocation of the asset transfer protocol between two gateways:

247	   *  Identification of gateway-owners: The owners of the two
248	      corresponding gateways are assumed to have been identified and
249	      their ownership status verified.

251	   *  Gateway liabilities: Gateways are performing digital signatures on
252	      messages.  As such, gateway operators are assumed to take on the
253	      relevant liabilities for signing the messages.

255	   *  Gateway message signatures: All messages between gateways are
256	      assumed to be signed and verified (e.g. with X.509).

258	   *  Transitory control of asset by gateway: An asset being transferred
259	      via SAT will technically be controlled by gateway throughout the
260	      transfer duration to ensure the state of the asset is not modified
261	      by another entity.  Gateway owners are liable for the asset
262	      throughout this duration.

264	   *  Network data: Gateways are assumed to have mechanisms in place to
265	      trust data returned from their local networks.  This will depend
266	      on the technical architecture and capabilities of each specific
267	      network.

269	   *  Gateways are trusted: The gateways are assumed to be trusted to
270	      carry-out all the stages of the protocol described in this
271	      architecture.

273	4.  Gateway Interoperability Modes

275	   The current interoperability architecture based on gateways
276	   recognizes several types of transfer flows:

278	   *  Asset transfer: This refers to the transfer of a digital asset
279	      from the origin network to a destination network, where a
280	      successful asset transfer causes the asset to be extinguished
281	      (burned) in the origin network and be regenerated (minted) at the
282	      destination network.

284	   *  Data transfer: This refers to the transfer of data only under
285	      authorization, in such a way that the data can be verified by a
286	      third party.  The data transfer mode addresses the use-cases where
287	      the state update in one network or system depends on the existence
288	      of state information recorded in a different network or system.

290	   *  Asset exchange (swap): This refers to the case where two users are
291	      present in two networks, and they perform concurrent and atomic
292	      swaps of two assets in the two corresponding networks, without
293	      transferring the assets outside (i.e. across) the networks.  The
294	      gateways aid in coordinating the messages pertaining to the swap.

296	   The current SATP architecture can be extended to address the use-
297	   cases pertaining to asset exchanges (swap) between two entities, both
298	   of which are assumed to be present in the origin and destination
299	   asset networks.  Similarly, the SATP architecture can be utilized for
300	   the data transfer mode to report the state of an asset within a
301	   private network, where the gateway acts as an intermediary.  However,
302	   the asset exchange and data transfer mode will be addressed in future
303	   specifications.

305	   The remainder of this architecture document will focus on the asset
306	   transfer flows.

308	5.  Architecture

310	5.1.  Goal of Architecture

312	   The goal of the interoperability architecture is to permit two (2)
313	   gateways belonging to distinct networks to conduct a transfer of
314	   digital assets transfer between them, in a secure, atomic and
315	   verifiable manner.

317	   The asset as understood by the two gateways is expressed in an
318	   standard digital format in a way meaningful to the gateway
319	   syntactically and semantically.

321	   The architecture recognizes that there are different networks
322	   currently in operation and evolving, and that in many cases the
323	   interior technical constructs in these networks maybe incompatible
324	   with one another.

326	   The architecture therefore assumes that in addition to implementing
327	   the bilateral secure asset transfer protocol, a gateway has the role
328	   of making opaque (i.e. hiding) the constructs that are local and
329	   specific to its network.

331	   Overall this approach ensures a high degree of interoperability
332	   across these networks, where each network can operate as a true
333	   autonomous system.  Additionally, this approach permits each network
334	   to evolve its interior technology implementations without affecting
335	   other (external) networks.

337	   The current architecture focuses on unidirectional asset transfers,
338	   although the building blocks in this architecture can be used to
339	   support protocols for bidirectional transfers.

341	   For simplicity the current architecture employs two (2) gateways per
342	   transfer as the basic building block, with one gateway in the origin
343	   and destination networks respectively.  However, the architecture
344	   seeks to be extensible to address future cases involving multiple
345	   gateways at both sides.

347	   The abstract construct of the gateway is used to represent endpoints
348	   that implement the asset transfer protocol interactions and the
349	   business logic that coordinates the transfer protocol steps until
350	   completion satisfying the ACID properties and ensuring liveliness of
351	   the protocol interactions.  In classical distributed databases, this
352	   business logic is often referred to as the transaction manager or the
353	   transaction coordinator.  This architecture specification does not
354	   prescribe any implementations of gateways.

356	5.2.  Overview of Asset Transfer

358	   An asset transfer between two networks is performed using a secure
359	   asset transfer protocol implemented by the gateways in the respective
360	   networks.  The two gateways implement the protocol in a direct
361	   interaction (unmediated).

363	   A successful transfer results in the asset being extinguished
364	   (burned) at the origin network, and for the asset to be regenerated
365	   (minted) at the destination network.

367	   The secure asset transfer protocol provides a coordination between
368	   the two gateways through the various message flows in the protocol
369	   that is communicated over a secure channel.

371	   The protocol implements a commitment mechanism between the two
372	   gateways to ensure that the relevant properties atomicity,
373	   consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) are achieved in the
374	   transfer.

376	   The mechanism to extinguish (burn) or regenerate (mint) an asset
377	   from/into a network by its gateway is dependent on the specific
378	   network and is outside the scope of the current architecture
379	   specification.  The mechanisms used to provide cryptographic proofs
380	   that an asset has been burned or minted in a given network is also
381	   out of scope.

383	   As part of the commitment mechanism, the sender gateway in the origin
384	   network must deliver a signed assertion to the receiver gateway at
385	   the destination network which states that asset in question has been
386	   extinguished (burned) from the origin network.

388	   Similarly, the receiver gateway at the destination network must in
389	   return deliver a signed assertion to the sender gateway at the origin
390	   network which states that the asset has been regenerated (minted) in
391	   the destination network.

393	   These two tasks must be performed in a synchronized fashion between
394	   the two gateways, and the commitment mechanism must provide
395	   sufficient evidence of the asset transfer that is verifiable by an
396	   authorized third party.

398	5.3.  Desirable Properties of Asset Transfer

400	   The desirable features of asset transfers between two gateways
401	   include, but not limited, to the following:

403	   *  Atomicity: A transfer must either commit or entirely fail (failure
404	      means no change to asset state).

406	   *  Consistency: A transfer (commit or fail) always leaves the
407	      networks in a consistent state (i.e. the asset is located in one
408	      network only at any time).

410	   *  Isolation: While the transfer is occurring, the asset state cannot
411	      be modified in the origin network.

413	   *  Durability: Once a transfer has been committed by both gateways,
414	      it must remain so regardless of subsequent gateway crashes.

416	   *  Liveliness and safety: The asset transfer protocol results in both
417	      gateways reaching a non-blocking state (commits or aborts)
418	      satisfying the above ACID properties.

420	   *  Verifiable by authorized third parties: The proof that the asset
421	      has been extinguished in the origin network, and the proof that
422	      the asset has been generated in the destination network must be
423	      verifiable by an authorized third party.

425	   An implementation of the asset transfer protocol should satisfy these
426	   properties, independent of whether the implementation employs
427	   stateful messaging or stateless messaging between the two gateways.

429	   Performing an asset transfer safely and securely is not simply a
430	   matter of communicating desire or intent between two systems
431	   represented by gateways, though such communication is a necessary
432	   part of asset transfer.  The systems, or at least their gateway
433	   proxies, must be interoperable in order to transfer assets among
434	   themselves, but such interoperability imposes strictly more demands
435	   on systems managing digital assets, especially systems that are built
436	   on distributed ledgers, compared to conventional communication
437	   interoperability.

439	   Communication interoperability, which is concerned with syntax and
440	   semantics of information geared towards producing a common
441	   understanding (or knowledge reconciliation) among systems, is
442	   insufficient to fulfill an asset transfer that requires systems to
443	   carry out state updates in concert with each other.  But
444	   communication, or messaging standards, play a necessary and
445	   complementary role to asset transfer protocols.  An exemplar of this
446	   is ISO 20022, which is a comprehensive global standard for financial
447	   messaging that specifies message syntax for common actions occurring
448	   in financial business processes, including payments, credit card
449	   transactions, securities settlements, funds, and trade [ISO20022].
450	   This standard provides the tools to model business processes from
451	   basic logical building blocks and schemas to construct messages using
452	   common formats like XML, JSON, and ASN.1.

454	   As discussed later, such messaging standards are useful to
455	   communicate information about the states of processes and digital
456	   assets across systems, to make requests, and to convey intent.  They
457	   therefore play a necessary and complementary role in asset transfer
458	   protocols.  However they are by themselves insufficient to ensure the
459	   ACID and verifiability properties described earlier.  Another way to
460	   think about the relationship between messaging standards like ISO
461	   20022 and asset transfer protocols is that the former is concerned
462	   with the "what" of cross-system interoperability whereas the latter
463	   is concerned with the "how".  Both kinds of protocols treat systems
464	   as black boxes, but asset transfer protocols must place some
465	   responsibility, and depend, on systems to drive a protocol instance
466	   to successful conclusion.

468	5.4.  Event log-data, crash recovery and backup gateways

470	   Implementations of a gateway should maintain event logs and
471	   checkpoints for the purpose of gateway crash recovery.  The log-data
472	   generated by a gateway should be considered as an interior resource
473	   accessible to other authorized gateways within the same network.

475	   The mechanism used to provide gateway crash-recovery is dependent on
476	   the specific network.  For interoperability purposes the information
477	   contained in the log and the format of the log-data should be
478	   standardized.

480	   A standardized semantics and syntax for log-data generated by SATP
481	   gateways in the context of asset transfers enables multiple
482	   implementations of gateways to serve a given asset network.  For
483	   example, an asset transfer session interrupted by a crashed gateway
484	   could be resumed by another gateway if the log-data was accessible to
485	   the second gateway and was in a standardized format.

487	   The resumption of an interrupted transfer session (e.g. due to
488	   gateway crash, network failure, etc.) should take into consideration
489	   the aspects of secure channel establishment and the aspects of the
490	   transfer protocol resumption.  In some cases, a new secure channel
491	   (e.g. TLS session) may need to be established between the two
492	   gateways, before a resumption of the transfer can begin.

494	   The log-data collected by a gateway acts also as a checkpoint
495	   mechanism to assist the recovered (or backup) gateway in continuing
496	   the transfer.  The point at which to re-start the transfer protocol
497	   flow is dependent on the implementation of the gateway recovery
498	   strategy.

500	5.5.  Overview of the Stages in Asset Transfer

502	   The interaction between two gateways in the secure asset transfer
503	   protocol is summarized in Figure 1, where the origin network is NW1
504	   and the destination network is NW2.  The gateways are denoted as G1
505	   and G2 respectively.

529	                                  Figure 1

531	   The stages are summarized as follows.

533	   *  Stage 0: Pre-transfer Verification and Context Establishment.  The
534	      two applications utilized by the originator and beneficiary are
535	      assumed to interact as part of the asset transfer.  In this stage,
536	      the applications App1 and App2 may establish some shared transfer
537	      context information (e.g.  Context-ID) at the application level
538	      that will be made available to their respective gateways G1 and
539	      G2.  The verification of the identities of the Originator and
540	      Beneficiary may occur in this stage.  This stage is outside the
541	      scope of the current architecture specification.  The Travel Rule
542	      is defined by the Financial Action Task Force [FATF] as the
543	      international policy-making body to combat money laundering and
544	      terrorist financing.  The FATF Recommendation 16 (2018) requires
545	      that customer information be obtained and validated prior to
546	      digital asset transfers.

548	   *  Stage 1: Transfer Initiation and Commencement.  In this stage
549	      gateways G1 and G2 must exchange information (claims) regarding
550	      the asset to be transferred, the identity information of the
551	      Originator and Beneficiary and other information regarding
552	      relevant actors (e.g. gateway owner/operator).  The main task in
553	      this stage is for both gateways to finalize the parameters
554	      previously negotiated in Stage 0 and to agree to commence the
555	      transfer.

557	   *  Stage 2: Lock Assertion and Receipt.  In this stage, gateway G1
558	      must provide gateway G2 with a signed assertion that the asset in
559	      NW1 has been immobilized and under the control on G1.  A signed
560	      assertion is needed because NW1 may be a private or closed
561	      network, and therefore the state-database (ledger) in NW1 is not
562	      readable by external entities including by G2.  This means that
563	      gateway G1 must make an explicit signed assertion about the state
564	      in NW1.  Note that the owner/operator of G1 takes on liability in
565	      signing this assertion.

567	   *  Stage 3: Commitment Preparation and Finalization.  In this stage
568	      gateways G1 and G2 commit to the unidirectional asset transfer
569	      using a 3PC (3-phase commit) subprotocol.

571	   These stages will be further discussed below.

573	6.  Pre-transfer Verification and Context Establishment (Stage-0)

575	   Although Stage 0 is out of scope for the current architecture, it is
576	   discussed here in order to provide background with the regards to the
577	   various asset verification requirements prior to commencing the
578	   transfer in Stage 1.

580	   Several tasks need to be conducted as part of the pre-transfer:

582	   *  Application level ContextID establishment: The application (App1)
583	      used by the originator and the application (App2) used by the
584	      beneficiary may need to establish a transfer context identifier
585	      (contextID) to uniquely identity the transfer at the application
586	      level.

588	   *  Identification of the asset in the origin network: The specific
589	      asset in the origin network NW1 must be located and identified,
590	      and its ownership be verified by gateway G1.  A gateway should not
591	      transfer assets whose ownership is unverified.  An asset may be
592	      identified by way of a combination of the network-identifier and a
593	      cryptographic hash of the ledger data representing the asset.
594	      Other syntax may also be used, such as [ISO20022] or ITIN [ITIN].

596	   *  Verification of the class or type of asset: The receiving gateway
597	      G2 may need to verify the class or type of asset that is to be
598	      transferred by gateway G1 in network NW1.  This is to ensure that
599	      the asset type/class conforms to the governing policies in the
600	      destination network NW2.  Additionally, gateway G2 must ensure
601	      that network NW2 can technologically receive (mint) the asset of
602	      that given type/class.  Asset schema definitions and asset profiles
603	      may assist in this verification process.

605	   *  Validation of asset ownership status: The gateway G1 in the origin
606	      network NW1 must ensure that an asset to be transferred to an
607	      external network is owned by the originator who is requesting the
608	      transfer.

610	   *  Authorization to transfer: The gateway G1 must obtain
611	      authorization from the owner of the asset (originator) to perform
612	      the transfer to the beneficiary in network NW2.  Similarly, the
613	      gateway G2 serving network NW2 must obtain authorization from the
614	      beneficiary to receive the transfer and assign the asset to the
615	      beneficiary in NW2.

617	   *  Exchange of Travel Rule information and validation: In
618	      jurisdictions where the Travel Rule policies regarding originator
619	      and beneficiary information is enforced [FATF], the owners of
620	      gateways G1 and G2 must comply to the Travel Rule.  Mechanisms
621	      must be used to permit gateways G1 and G2 to make available
622	      originator/beneficiary information to one another in such a away
623	      that the Travel Rule information can be logged as part of the
624	      asset transfer history.

626	   *  Validation of the gateway ownership: There must be a means for
627	      gateway G1 and G2 to verify their respective ownerships (i.e.
628	      entities owning G1 and G2 respectively).  Examples of ownership
629	      verification mechanism include X.509 certificates, directories of
630	      gateways and owners, and others.

632	   *  Mutual device attestations: In cases where device attestation
633	      [RATS] is required, each gateway must yield attestation evidence
634	      to the other regarding its configuration.  A gateway may take on
635	      the role as a attestation verifier, or it may rely on an external
636	      verifier to appraise the received evidence.

638	   *  Negotiation of transfer protocol and network parameters: Gateway
639	      G1 and G2 must agree on the parameters to be employed within the
640	      asset transfer protocol.  Examples include endpoints definitions
641	      for resources, duration of time-outs of messages, type of
642	      commitment flows (e.g. 2PC or 3PC), signature algorithms, average
643	      lock-time durations in their respective networks, and others.

645	   The current specification seeks to reuse as much as possible the
646	   existing standards related to digital assets.  We seek to rely on
647	   existing messaging standards like ISO 20022 [ISO20022] or ITIN [ITIN]
648	   for gateway ownership validation, owner status validation, asset
649	   profile identification, and communication of travel rule and transfer
650	   context information.  For identification of digital assets maintained
651	   by distributed ledgers or blockchain systems, we can also rely on
652	   standards like ITIN [ITIN].

654	7.  Transfer Initiation and Commencement (Stage-1)

656	   In Stage 1 the sender gateway (G1) and the receiver gateway (G2) must
657	   explicitly accept the parameters of the transfer which were
658	   negotiated in the pre-transfer stage (Stage 0).

660	   This explicit acceptance of the parameters takes the form of gateway
661	   G1 sending a signed Transfer Proposal message containing a Transfer
662	   Initiation Claims set (namely the parameters agreed upon in Stage 0),
663	   and for the gateway G2 to respond with a signed Proposal Receipt
664	   message which carries a hash of the proposal message.

666	       App1  DB1          G1                     G2          DB2    App2

693	                               Figure 2

695	   There are several steps that may occur in Stage 1:

697	   *  Secure channel establishment between G1 and G2: This includes the
698	      mutual verification of the gateway device identities and the
699	      exchange of the relevant parameters for secure channel
700	      establishment.

702	   *  Transfer Proposal message (1.1): Gateway G1 sends a signed
703	      transfer proposal message that contains the Transfer Initiation
704	      Claims to gateway G2.  The claims carry the parameters negotiated
705	      in Stage 0 (pre-transfer negotiations).

707	   *  Proposal Receipt (1.2): The gateway G2 indicates acceptance of the
708	      parameters in the Transfer Initiation Claims by way of sending a
709	      signed Proposal Receipt message to G1.  If gateway G2 decides not
710	      to accept parameters in the Transfer Initiation Claims, then G2
711	      can send an abort message to G1, or simply ignore the message
712	      (time-out).

714	   *  Transfer Commence message (1.3): Once gateway G1 receives the
715	      signed Proposal Receipt from gateway G2, gateway G1 is ready to
716	      signal the commencement of the asset transfer.  This is done by
717	      gateway G1 sending a signed Transfer Commence message to G2.

719	   *  Commence Acknowledgement message (1.4): Gateway G2 accepts the
720	      formal commencement of the transfer by responding with a signed
721	      Commence ACK message.

723	   It is important to note the logical separation between the transfer
724	   proposal/receipt messages from the commencement messages.  This
725	   separation allows the gateways to decline to proceed during the
726	   proposal finalization (1.1 and 1.2), prior to starting the 2PC
727	   subprotocol which formally begins at the Commence messages (1.3 and
728	   1.4).

730	   This logical separation is useful because in some implementations the
731	   decision to start the commencement (1.3 and 1.4) implies that the
732	   gateways and network have sufficient resource to complete the
733	   transfer.  Gateways that experience extreme loads may use this
734	   separation to slightly delay the commencement until their loads
735	   subsides.

737	   Note that some implementations may choose to enable a multi-round
738	   interactions for steps 1.1 and 1.2.

740	8.  Asset Lock Assertion and Receipt (Stage 2)

742	   In this stage, gateway G1 must issue a signed assertion that the
743	   asset in origin network NW1 has been immobilized and under the
744	   control of G1.

746	   The steps of Stage 2 are summarized in Figure 4, and broadly consists
747	   of the following:

749	   *  G1 Lock/Escrow Asset (2.1): Gateway G1 proceeds to establish a
750	      lock or escrow the asset belonging to the originator.  This
751	      prevents other local transactions in NW1 from changing the state
752	      of the asset until such time the lock by G1 is finalized or
753	      released.  A time-lock or escrow may also be employed.

755	   *  Lock Assertion (2.2): Gateway G1 sends a digitally signed
756	      assertion regarding the locked (escrowed or immobilized) state on
757	      the asset in network NW1.  The signature by G1 is performed using
758	      its entity public-key pair.  This signature signifies that G1
759	      (i.e. its owner/operator) is standing behind its statement
760	      regarding the locked/escrowed state on the asset.  The mechanism
761	      to lock or immobilize the asset is outside the scope of secure
762	      asset transfer protocol.

764	   *  G2 Logs Lock-Assertion Information (2.3): Gateway G2 logs/records
765	      a copy of the signed lock-assertion message received in Step 2.4
766	      to its local state data DB2.  G2 may also notify the fact of the
767	      lock-assertion to all members of network NW2.  The mechanism to
768	      log and to notify is also out of scope.

770	   *  Lock-Assertion Receipt (2.4): If gateway G2 accepts the signed
771	      assertion from G1, then G2 responds with a digitally signed
772	      receipt message which includes a hash of the previous lock-
773	      assertion message.  The signature by G2 is performed using its
774	      entity public-key pair.  Otherwise, if G2 declines accepting the
775	      assertion then G2 can simply ignore the transfer and let the
776	      session time-out (i.e. transfer attempt has failed).

798	   The purpose of the signed lock-assertion is for dispute resolution
799	   between G1 and G2 (i.e. the entities who own and operate G1 and G2
800	   respectively) in the case that asset state inconsistencies in NW1 and
801	   NW2 are discovered later.

803	   The gateway G2 must return a digitally signed receipt to G1 regarding
804	   the earlier signed lock-assertion in order to cover G1 (exculpatory
805	   proof) in the case of later denial by G2.

807	9.  Commitment Preparation and Finalization (Stage 3)

809	   In Stage 3 the gateways G1 and G2 commit to the asset transfer by
810	   making permanent the changes they made to the respective networks
811	   (ledgers).  The previous signed receipt message (2.4) from gateway G2
812	   to gateway G1 signals the start of the commitment subprotocol in
813	   Stage 3.

815	   Upon receiving the signed receipt message from G2 in the previous
816	   stage, G1 begins the commitment (see Figure 5):

818	   *  Commit-prepare (3.1): Gateway G1 indicates to G2 to prepare for
819	      the commitment of the transfer.  This message should include
820	      hashes of the previous messages (message 2.2 and 2.4).

822	   *  Temporary asset mint (3.2): Gateway G2 creates (mints) an
823	      equivalent asset in NW2 assigned to itself as the owner.  This
824	      step can be reversed (i.e. asset destroyed) in the case of the
825	      failure in the commitment steps because G2 is still the owner of
826	      the asset in NW2.

828	   *  Commit-ready (3.3): Gateway G2 sends a commit-ready message to G1
829	      indicating that it is ready to carry-out the last steps of the
830	      commitment subprotocol.  Note that that the entire asset transfer
831	      session can be aborted before this step without affecting the
832	      asset state in the respective networks.

834	   *  Asset burn (3.4): Gateway G1 extinguishes (burns) the asset in
835	      network NW1 which it has locked since Step 2.3.

837	   *  Commit-final assertion (3.5): Gateway G1 indicates to G2 that G1
838	      has performed the extinguishment of the asset in NW1.  This
839	      message must be digitally signed by G1.

841	   *  Asset-assignment (3.6): Gateway G2 assigns the minted asset (which
842	      it has been self-holding since Step 3.2) to the Beneficiary.

844	   *  ACK-final receipt (3.7): Gateway G2 sends a signed assertion that
845	      it has assigned the asset to the intended Beneficiary.

847	   *  Record receipt (3.8): Gateway G1 logs/records a copy of the signed
848	      receipt message to its local state data DB1.  G1 may also notify
849	      the fact of the signed receipt to all members of network NW1.  The
850	      mechanism to log and notify is out of scope.

852	   *  Transfer complete (3.9): Gateway G1 must explicitly close the
853	      asset transfer session with gateway G2.  This allows both sides to
854	      close down the secure channel established earlier in Stage 1.

888	10.  The Commitment sub-protocol

890	   Within Stage 3, the gateways must implement one (or more)
891	   transactional commitment sub-protocols that permit the coordination
892	   between two gateways, and the final commitment of the asset transfer.

894	   In the case that there are multiple commitment subprotocols supported
895	   by the gateways, the choice of the sub-protocol (type/version) and
896	   the corresponding commitment evidence must be negotiated between the
897	   gateways during Stage 0.

899	   For example, in Stage 2 and Stage 3 discussed above the gateways G1
900	   and G2 may implement the classic 2-Phase or 3-Phase Commit (2PC or
901	   3PC) sub-protocol [Gray81] as a means to ensure efficient and non-
902	   disputable commitments to the asset transfer.

904	   Historically, transactional commitment protocols employ locking
905	   mechanisms to prevent update conflicts on the data item in question.
906	   When used within the context of digital asset transfers across
907	   networks, the fact that an asset has been locked in NW1 must be
908	   communicated via an assertion to G2 (as the 3PC participant) in an
909	   indisputable manner.

911	   Similarly, G2 must return a signed assertion to G1 that the asset has
912	   been regenerated (minted) in NW2.

914	   These signed assertions must be verifiable by an authorized third
915	   party, in the case that disputes occur (post event) or where audit is
916	   required on the asset transfer.

918	   The precise form of these assertions must be standardized (for the
919	   given transactional commitment protocol) to eliminate any ambiguity.

921	11.  Security Considerations

923	   As an asset network holds an increasing number of digital assets, it
924	   may become attractive to attackers seeking to compromise the
925	   cryptographic keys of the entities, services and its end-users.

927	   Gateways are of particular interest to attackers because they enable
928	   the transferal of digital assets to external networks, which may or
929	   may not be regulated.  As such, hardening technologies and tamper-
930	   resistant crypto-processors (e.g. TPM, SGX) should be used for
931	   implementations of gateways [HS19].

933	   The SAT protocol faces challenges with regards to the confidentiality
934	   of a transfer between gateways, and the potential issue related to a
935	   denial-of-service (and resource waste) when either gateway is not
936	   compliant with the protocol.

938	   For confidentiality of a transfer, the secure asset transfer protocol
939	   must utilize a TLS1.2 (TLS1.3) secure channel that must be
940	   established between the sender gateway (G1) and the receiver gateway
941	   (G2).  The two gateways must first establish this secure channel at
942	   the start of Stage 1 before they can proceed to execute the asset
943	   transfer protocol.  This includes both gateways verifying all the
944	   relevant parameters required for their TLS1.2 session (e.g. correct
945	   TLS endpoints, certificate validation, identity validation, etc.).

947	   There are several challenges that may arise when gateways are not
948	   compliant with the SAT protocol.  Some of these are described below.

950	11.1.  Multiple intentional aborts by the sender gateway

952	   A dishonest sender gateway G1 may purposely fail to continue the
953	   protocol run at certain crucial points.  One such crucial point is in
954	   Stage-3, where the gateway G1 is expected to transmit the Commit-
955	   Final Assertion message (3.5).  If the gateway G1 intentionally fails
956	   to transmit this message, gateway G2 may conclude that the message
957	   has been lost and may proceed to reverse the temporary hold it has
958	   previously created (temporary asset mint in message 3.2).  Although
959	   this dishonest behavior by G1 does not cause asset damage to G2 or
960	   NW2, it may exhaust computing resources at gateway G2.  If network
961	   NW2 incurs transaction fees, such a reversal may be costly for
962	   gateway G2.

964	11.2.  Multiple intentional aborts by the receiver gateway

966	   In a similar manner, a receiver gateway G2 may also purposely fail to
967	   continue the protocol run at certain crucial points.  One such point
968	   is the Commit-Ready message (3.3) that it should transmit to G1 after
969	   receiving the commit prepare message (3.1) from G1.  In this case,
970	   gateway G1 may conclude that the message is lost and simply abort the
971	   protocol run.

973	   Another possible denial-of-service attack could arise when G2
974	   purposefully fails to send a Lock-Assertion-Receipt (2.4), thereby
975	   forcing G1 to reverse its lock that was performed earlier (2.1).

977	11.3.  Failure to transmit ACK-Final Receipt

979	   Another possible point of attack by a dishonest gateway G2 may occur
980	   by the gateway intentionally failing to transmit the ACK-Final-
981	   Receipt (3.7) in response to the Commit-Final Assertion message (3.5)
982	   from gateway G1.  Here, the sender gateway G1 may conclude that the
983	   message is lost and will assume that the transaction has reach
984	   completion in network NW2.  The sender gateway G1 has retained the
985	   previous Lock-Assertion Receipt (2.4) in Stage-2 that was signed by
986	   G2, indicating that the gateway G2 has accepted the responsibility of
987	   ensuring that the asset-assignment (3.6) by G2 will be correctly
988	   executed.  Failure by G2 to complete this task may become a liability
989	   for the owner of gateway G2.

991	   In general, it is recommended that multiple redundant gateways be
992	   utilized within a network to mitigate a single gateway's malicious
993	   behavior.  Furthermore, there are gateway recovery and failover
994	   mechanisms that have been defined in [BCH21].

996	11.4.  Failure to extinguish asset

998	   Another potential attack may come from a dishonest gateway G1 who
999	   intentionally fails to extinguish the asset in network NW1 (in step
1000	   3.4).  This means G1 is henceforth in control of the asset.  This
1001	   type of denial-of-service is network specific because it implies that
1002	   G1 was able to perform a lock on the asset on behalf of the asset-
1003	   owner (i.e. originator) through one or more mechanisms supported by
1004	   network NW1 independent of (and prior to) the secure asset transfer
1005	   protocol.

1007	   This denial-of-service is out of scope for the current architecture
1008	   specification because it represents a weakness on the part of the
1009	   network NW1.

1011	11.5.  Identity impersonations

1013	   Another vector of attack may involve a gateway that impersonates an
1014	   asset holder in a given network.  For example, a gateway G1 may
1015	   pretend to be the owner of an asset (originator) in network NW1 and
1016	   proceed to transfer it to a beneficiary located in network NW2.

1018	   The verification of the identity of the originator and beneficiary
1019	   must be performed as part of the set-up stage (Stage 0) as described
1020	   in Section 6, which is currently out-of-scope for the secure asset
1021	   transfer protocol.

1023	   The identity verification includes that of the owner of gateways G1
1024	   and G2 respectively.  Standard protocols for federated identity
1025	   management already exist and have wide deployment.

1027	12.  Policy Considerations

1029	   Digital asset transfers must be policy-driven in the sense that it
1030	   must observe and enforce the policies defined for both networks.
1031	   Resources that make-up a network are owned and operated by entities
1032	   (e.g. typically persons or organizations), and these entities
1033	   typically operate within regulatory jurisdictions [FATF].  It is the
1034	   responsibility of these entities to translate regulatory policies
1035	   into functions on networks that comply to the relevant regulatory
1036	   policies.

1038	   At the application layer, asset transfers must take into
1039	   consideration the status of assets and incorporate relevant asset-
1040	   related policies into their business logic.  These policies must
1041	   permeate down to the gateways that implement the functions of asset
1042	   transaction processing.

1044	13.  Compatibility Considerations

1046	   As the asset transfer protocol must be agnostic to the anatomy of a
1047	   digital asset and to the type of ledger technology underlying a
1048	   system maintaining digital assets, it must be compatible with
1049	   different asset identification standards like ISO 20022 and ITIN, and
1050	   with standards for communicating information about business processes
1051	   (like ISO 20022).  Keeping the Stage-0 specification open and not
1052	   tied to a specific messaging or identification standard allows the
1053	   Secure Asset Transfer architecture to be flexible and inclusive, and
1054	   thereby meet compatibility goals.
