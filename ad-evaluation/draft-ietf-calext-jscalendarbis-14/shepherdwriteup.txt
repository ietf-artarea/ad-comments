# Document Shepherd Write-Up for Group Documents

*This version is dated 4 July 2022.*

Thank you for your service as a document shepherd. Among the responsibilities is
answering the questions in this write-up to give helpful context to Last Call
and Internet Engineering Steering Group ([IESG][1]) reviewers, and your
diligence in completing it is appreciated. The full role of the shepherd is
further described in [<a href="/doc/rfc4858/">RFC 4858</a>][2]. You will need the cooperation of the authors
and editors to complete these checks.

Note that some numbered items contain multiple related questions; please be sure
to answer all of them.

## Document History

1. Does the working group (WG) consensus represent the strong concurrence of a
few individuals, with others being silent, or did it reach broad agreement?

Yes

2. Was there controversy about particular points, or were there decisions where
the consensus was particularly rough?

No

3. Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If
so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the
responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this
questionnaire is publicly available.)

No

4. For protocol documents, are there existing implementations of the contents of
the document? Have a significant number of potential implementers indicated
plans to implement? Are any existing implementations reported somewhere,
either in the document itself (as [<a href="/doc/rfc7942/">RFC 7942</a>][3] recommends) or elsewhere
(where)?

Yes. Fastmail is implementing it, but there are other partial implementations.

## Additional Reviews

5. Do the contents of this document closely interact with technologies in other
IETF working groups or external organizations, and would it therefore benefit
from their review? Have those reviews occurred? If yes, describe which
reviews took place.

This is a bis document, which means that people are using JSCalendar and wanted
to improve it. The comments and reviews are coming from implementers, and
interoperabilities. A lot of discussions are also happening outside the IETF in
the Calconnect forum.

6. Describe how the document meets any required formal expert review criteria,
such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.

It is evident that experts are present in the working group. I do not believe
that further expert reviews are necessary. Furthermore, since this is a bis
document, many of the reviews conducted on the initial version are also
relevant here.

7. If the document contains a YANG module, has the final version of the module
been checked with any of the [recommended validation tools][4] for syntax and
formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is
the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module
comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified
in [<a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC 8342</a>][5]?

No YANG.

8. Describe reviews and automated checks performed to validate sections of the
final version of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code,
BNF rules, MIB definitions, CBOR&#x27;s CDDL, etc.

None of these. Only JSON is used.

## Document Shepherd Checks

9. Based on the shepherd&#x27;s review of the document, is it their opinion that this
document is needed, clearly written, complete, correctly designed, and ready
to be handed off to the responsible Area Director?

The document is in my opinion very clear. Much clearer than the previous
versions !

10. Several IETF Areas have assembled [lists of common issues that their
reviewers encounter][6]. For which areas have such issues been identified
and addressed? For which does this still need to happen in subsequent
reviews?

Base 64

section 1.4.1 Id
Where Id is given as a data type, it means a String of at least 1 and
a maximum of 255 octets in size, and it MUST only contain characters
from the &quot;URL and Filename Safe&quot; base64url alphabet, as defined in
Section 5 of [<a href="/doc/rfc4648/">RFC4648</a>], excluding the pad character (=). This means
the allowed characters are the ASCII alphanumeric characters (A-Za-
z0-9), hyphen (-), and underscore (_).

Date and time: The document details the synthax:

section 1.4.4. UTCDateTime
This is a string in the date-time [<a href="/doc/rfc3339/">RFC3339</a>] format, with the further
restrictions that any letters MUST be in uppercase, and the time
offset MUST be the character Z. Fractional second values MUST NOT be
included.¶
For example, 2010-10-10T10:10:10Z is conformant, but
2010-10-10T10:10:10.0Z or 2010-10-10T10:10:10.123Z are invalid.¶

11. What type of RFC publication is being requested on the IETF stream ([Best
Current Practice][12], [Proposed Standard, Internet Standard][13],
[Informational, Experimental or Historic][14])? Why is this the proper type
of RFC? Do all Datatracker state attributes correctly reflect this intent?

Standard track is appropriated as itis required for interoperability.

12. Have reasonable efforts been made to remind all authors of the intellectual
property rights (IPR) disclosure obligations described in [<a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a>][7]? To
the best of your knowledge, have all required disclosures been filed? If
not, explain why. If yes, summarize any relevant discussion, including links
to publicly-available messages when applicable.

Yes. Both authors responded to question 12 and 13.
<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/calsify/FTKjcVMvdGXnqHxi93WUxErUVHc/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/calsify/FTKjcVMvdGXnqHxi93WUxErUVHc/</a>
<a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/calsify/1JcSy7PJIwSNm9Gspz50Azqzf7E/">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/calsify/1JcSy7PJIwSNm9Gspz50Azqzf7E/</a>

13. Has each author, editor, and contributor shown their willingness to be
listed as such? If the total number of authors and editors on the front page
is greater than five, please provide a justification.

see above.

14. Document any remaining I-D nits in this document. Simply running the [idnits
tool][8] is not enough; please review the [&quot;Content Guidelines&quot; on
<a href="http://authors.ietf.org">authors.ietf.org</a>][15]. (Also note that the current idnits tool generates
some incorrect warnings; a rewrite is underway.)

-- Possible downref: Non-RFC (?) normative reference: ref. &#x27;CLDR&#x27;

-- Possible downref: Non-RFC (?) normative reference: ref. &#x27;CSS3&#x27;

I beleive these are essential references for implementers, so having them as
normative reference seems fine to me.

** Obsolete normative reference: <a href="/doc/rfc2445/">RFC 2445</a> (Obsoleted by <a href="/doc/rfc5545/">RFC 5545</a>)

Both references have been cited, thus the present one is being referred to. It
is anticipated that both documents will be reviewed by the implementers.

-- Possible downref: Non-RFC (?) normative reference: ref. &#x27;TZDB&#x27;
This serves as an essential reference for the implementation; therefore, I
believe it is appropriate to include it in the normative reference section to
guarantee that everyone utilizes the same distinct source.

15. Should any informative references be normative or vice-versa? See the [IESG
Statement on Normative and Informative References][16].

No

16. List any normative references that are not freely available to anyone. Did
the community have sufficient access to review any such normative
references?

None.

17. Are there any normative downward references (see [<a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>][9] and [<a href="/doc/bcp97/">BCP
97</a>][10]) that are not already listed in the [DOWNREF registry][17]? If so,
list them.

see nits.

18. Are there normative references to documents that are not ready to be
submitted to the IESG for publication or are otherwise in an unclear state?
If so, what is the plan for their completion?

no.

19. Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? If
so, does the Datatracker metadata correctly reflect this and are those RFCs
listed on the title page, in the abstract, and discussed in the
introduction? If not, explain why and point to the part of the document
where the relationship of this document to these other RFCs is discussed.

This is mentionned in the title page, abnstract and intro.

20. Describe the document shepherd&#x27;s review of the IANA considerations section,
especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document.
Confirm that all aspects of the document requiring IANA assignments are
associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm
that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm
that each newly created IANA registry specifies its initial contents,
allocations procedures, and a reasonable name (see [<a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>][11]).

The IANA section is based on the initial version of JSCal and has undergone
review by the IANA. We also consulted with IANA, which confirmed that the IANA
section meets their standards. They provided one comment, which has since been
addressed. The summarized comment and the author&#x27;s response can be found in the
following email.

Removed Properties. Should this entry instead have its “Intended Usage” field
updated rather than being removed entirely? Section 8.2.1.4 states: “JSCalendar
property registrations may not be deleted; properties that are no longer
believed appropriate for use can be declared obsolete by a change to their
‘intended usage’ field; such properties will be clearly marked in the IANA
registry.”

Yes, please obsolete rather than remove. I have updated the document to version
14, which removes section 8.2.3.3 and asks to obsolete the &quot;start&quot; property
with property context &quot;TimeZoneRule&quot; in section 8.2.3.1.

Thanks,
Robert

21. List any new IANA registries that require Designated Expert Review for
future allocations. Are the instructions to the Designated Expert clear?
Please include suggestions of designated experts, if appropriate.

Yes. These instructions are clear.
