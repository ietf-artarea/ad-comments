# Document Shepherd Write-Up for Group Documents

*This version is dated 4 July 2022.*

NOTE: This document should become part of C540.

## Document History

1. Does the working group (WG) consensus represent the strong concurrence of a
few individuals, with others being silent, or did it reach broad agreement?

The document reached broad consensus of the WG.  The WG includes about a dozen
"full-time" participants and a number of others that also contribute with less
regularity.

There were some issues that were raised but ultimately determined to be in the
rough.

2. Was there controversy about particular points, or were there decisions where
the consensus was particularly rough?

In the shepherd's opinion, consensus was comfortable (i.e., not particularly
rough), but in some cases it took quite some time to get there.  A few of the
issues raised were occasionally confusing to the bulk of the WG, which did a
diligent job trying to understand and propose compromises.

3. Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If
so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the
responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this
questionnaire is publicly available.)

There are no threats of appeal.

4. For protocol documents, are there existing implementations of the contents of
the document? Have a significant number of potential implementers indicated
plans to implement? Are any existing implementations reported somewhere,
either in the document itself (as [<a href="/doc/rfc7942/">RFC 7942</a>][3] recommends) or elsewhere
(where)?

Many of the practices identified by this document are informed by existing
implementations and common practices of a number of implementations of the base
documents and the other protocols referenced by this document.

## Additional Reviews

5. Do the contents of this document closely interact with technologies in other
IETF working groups or external organizations, and would it therefore benefit
from their review? Have those reviews occurred? If yes, describe which
reviews took place.

No such external or cross-WG reviews are warranted.

6. Describe how the document meets any required formal expert review criteria,
such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.

This document does not make use of MIBs, YANG, media types, or URIs, beyond
those already registered by the standards track documents referenced.

7. If the document contains a YANG module, has the final version of the module
been checked with any of the [recommended validation tools][4] for syntax and
formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is
the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module
comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified
in [<a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC 8342</a>][5]?

No YANG is present.

8. Describe reviews and automated checks performed to validate sections of the
final version of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code,
BNF rules, MIB definitions, CBOR's CDDL, etc.

No formal languages are used here.  There's a reference to ABNF, but none is
presented.

## Document Shepherd Checks

9. Based on the shepherd's review of the document, is it their opinion that this
document is needed, clearly written, complete, correctly designed, and ready
to be handed off to the responsible Area Director?

Yes to all of these.

10. Several IETF Areas have assembled [lists of common issues that their
reviewers encounter][6]. For which areas have such issues been identified
and addressed? For which does this still need to happen in subsequent
reviews?

The Email topics in the ART Area list are considered by this group, but there's
nothing outstanding.

11. What type of RFC publication is being requested on the IETF stream ([Best
Current Practice][12], [Proposed Standard, Internet Standard][13],
[Informational, Experimental or Historic][14])? Why is this the proper type
of RFC? Do all Datatracker state attributes correctly reflect this intent?

This document is an Applicability Statement, and as such is seeking Proposed
Standard status (<a href="/doc/rfc2026/">RFC 2026</a>, Section 3.2).  This is properly reflected in the
datatracker.

12. Have reasonable efforts been made to remind all authors of the intellectual
property rights (IPR) disclosure obligations described in [<a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a>][7]? To
the best of your knowledge, have all required disclosures been filed? If
not, explain why. If yes, summarize any relevant discussion, including links
to publicly-available messages when applicable.

I polled the authors off-list to confirm no outstanding <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP79</a> declarations
regarding the material in this document, and they so affirmed.

13. Has each author, editor, and contributor shown their willingness to be
listed as such? If the total number of authors and editors on the front page
is greater than five, please provide a justification.

The authors have also so affirmed via private email.

14. Document any remaining I-D nits in this document. Simply running the [idnits
tool][8] is not enough; please review the ["Content Guidelines" on
<a href="http://authors.ietf.org">authors.ietf.org</a>][15]. (Also note that the current idnits tool generates
some incorrect warnings; a rewrite is underway.)

Two nits of interest were identified:

== Missing Reference: 'RFC6530' is mentioned on line 413, but not defined

== Missing Reference: 'RFC5891' is mentioned on line 405, but not defined

This seems to be a fault in IDNits itself.  The document, for example, does
reference "[<a href="/doc/rfc6530/">RFC6530</a>]", but that RFC is actually part of a compound (i.e.,
multi-document) reference called "[SMTPUTF8]".  I'm not sure what guidance
there might be to clear this.  I've made some suggestions on the list.

15. Should any informative references be normative or vice-versa? See the [IESG
Statement on Normative and Informative References][16].

No, these look fine.

16. List any normative references that are not freely available to anyone. Did
the community have sufficient access to review any such normative
references?

All normative references are public.

17. Are there any normative downward references (see [<a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>][9] and [<a href="/doc/bcp97/">BCP
97</a>][10]) that are not already listed in the [DOWNREF registry][17]? If so,
list them.

There are no normative downward references that need to be registered.

18. Are there normative references to documents that are not ready to be
submitted to the IESG for publication or are otherwise in an unclear state?
If so, what is the plan for their completion?

No, this is the last in this cluster.

19. Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? If
so, does the Datatracker metadata correctly reflect this and are those RFCs
listed on the title page, in the abstract, and discussed in the
introduction? If not, explain why and point to the part of the document
where the relationship of this document to these other RFCs is discussed.

This document does not update the status of any other document.

20. Describe the document shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section,
especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document.
Confirm that all aspects of the document requiring IANA assignments are
associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm
that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm
that each newly created IANA registry specifies its initial contents,
allocations procedures, and a reasonable name (see [<a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>][11]).

There are no IANA actions in this document.

21. List any new IANA registries that require Designated Expert Review for
future allocations. Are the instructions to the Designated Expert clear?
Please include suggestions of designated experts, if appropriate.

There are no IANA actions in this document.
