# Document Shepherd Write-Up for Group Documents

*This version is dated 4 July 2022.*

Thank you for your service as a document shepherd. Among the responsibilities is
answering the questions in this write-up to give helpful context to Last Call
and Internet Engineering Steering Group ([IESG][1]) reviewers, and your
diligence in completing it is appreciated. The full role of the shepherd is
further described in [<a href="/doc/rfc4858/">RFC 4858</a>][2]. You will need the cooperation of the authors
and editors to complete these checks.

Note that some numbered items contain multiple related questions; please be sure
to answer all of them.

## Document History

1. Does the working group (WG) consensus represent the strong concurrence of a
few individuals, with others being silent, or did it reach broad agreement?

We had strong support for this document from a few people, and no negative
responses. For this document that is appropriate. The subject is of concern
only to the community that develops software for emergency call centers. They
have their own organization, with a few people that also participate in IETF
for their supporting documents.

2. Was there controversy about particular points, or were there decisions where
the consensus was particularly rough?

The reason for this document is to resolve an ambiguity across related RFCs
what values are to be used to represent the value of a parameter. There are
deployed implementations that conflict on this. Fixing this ambiguity
necessarily impacts some or all of those implementations. We reached agreement
on which values are to be used, but there remained some controversy whether to
do something to accommodate the "losers". We finally reached consensus that
implementations MUST send and accept the agreed upon values, but SHOULD also
*accept* the old conflicting values. There have been no objections to this.

3. Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If
so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the
responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this
questionnaire is publicly available.)

No.

4. For protocol documents, are there existing implementations of the contents of
the document? Have a significant number of potential implementers indicated
plans to implement? Are any existing implementations reported somewhere,
either in the document itself (as [<a href="/doc/rfc7942/">RFC 7942</a>][3] recommends) or elsewhere
(where)?

The point of this document is to resolve an ambiguity across several
specifications. This was discovered due to interoperability problems among real
implementations. The changes here choose one of the ambiguous interpretations.
Hence there are already some implementations compliant with this document.

## Additional Reviews

5. Do the contents of this document closely interact with technologies in other
IETF working groups or external organizations, and would it therefore benefit
from their review? Have those reviews occurred? If yes, describe which
reviews took place.

No. This is quite self-contained.

6. Describe how the document meets any required formal expert review criteria,
such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.

N/A

7. If the document contains a YANG module, has the final version of the module
been checked with any of the [recommended validation tools][4] for syntax and
formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is
the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module
comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified
in [<a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC 8342</a>][5]?

N/A

8. Describe reviews and automated checks performed to validate sections of the
final version of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code,
BNF rules, MIB definitions, CBOR's CDDL, etc.

None. This document makes some trivial modifications to xml (replacing one text
value with another) in examples of sip messages. Otherwise all the changes are
text. No validation needed.

## Document Shepherd Checks

9. Based on the shepherd's review of the document, is it their opinion that this
document is needed, clearly written, complete, correctly designed, and ready
to be handed off to the responsible Area Director?

Yes.

10. Several IETF Areas have assembled [lists of common issues that their
reviewers encounter][6]. For which areas have such issues been identified
and addressed? For which does this still need to happen in subsequent
reviews?

Nothing in the ART area list seems relevant here.

11. What type of RFC publication is being requested on the IETF stream ([Best
Current Practice][12], [Proposed Standard, Internet Standard][13],
[Informational, Experimental or Historic][14])? Why is this the proper type
of RFC? Do all Datatracker state attributes correctly reflect this intent?

Standards track, because it updates Standards Track documents.
(It also updates informational documents.)

12. Have reasonable efforts been made to remind all authors of the intellectual
property rights (IPR) disclosure obligations described in [<a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a>][7]? To
the best of your knowledge, have all required disclosures been filed? If
not, explain why. If yes, summarize any relevant discussion, including links
to publicly-available messages when applicable.

All the authors have been asked to do the necessary IPR disclosures, and have
confirmed that they have.

13. Has each author, editor, and contributor shown their willingness to be
listed as such? If the total number of authors and editors on the front page
is greater than five, please provide a justification.

Yes

14. Document any remaining I-D nits in this document. Simply running the [idnits
tool][8] is not enough; please review the ["Content Guidelines" on
<a href="http://authors.ietf.org">authors.ietf.org</a>][15]. (Also note that the current idnits tool generates
some incorrect warnings; a rewrite is underway.)

** Downref: Normative reference to an Informational RFC: <a href="/doc/rfc5606/">RFC 5606</a>
** Downref: Normative reference to an Informational RFC: <a href="/doc/rfc7378/">RFC 7378</a>

These downrefs are unavoidable. This document must be normative because
it updates normative documents as well as these informative documents.

15. Should any informative references be normative or vice-versa? See the [IESG
Statement on Normative and Informative References][16].

No.

16. List any normative references that are not freely available to anyone. Did
the community have sufficient access to review any such normative
references?

None

17. Are there any normative downward references (see [<a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a>][9] and [<a href="/doc/bcp97/">BCP
97</a>][10]) that are not already listed in the [DOWNREF registry][17]? If so,
list them.

No

18. Are there normative references to documents that are not ready to be
submitted to the IESG for publication or are otherwise in an unclear state?
If so, what is the plan for their completion?

No

19. Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? If
so, does the Datatracker metadata correctly reflect this and are those RFCs
listed on the title page, in the abstract, and discussed in the
introduction? If not, explain why and point to the part of the document
where the relationship of this document to these other RFCs is discussed.

No

20. Describe the document shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section,
especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document.
Confirm that all aspects of the document requiring IANA assignments are
associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm
that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm
that each newly created IANA registry specifies its initial contents,
allocations procedures, and a reasonable name (see [<a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>][11]).

There is no impact on IANA.

21. List any new IANA registries that require Designated Expert Review for
future allocations. Are the instructions to the Designated Expert clear?
Please include suggestions of designated experts, if appropriate.

N/A
