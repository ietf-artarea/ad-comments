Thanks for the work on this document. It is very straightforward.

## Comments

### Pre RFC 5378 Contributions

The nits checker gives us this:

     (Using the creation date from RFC4119, updated by this document, for
     RFC5378 checks: 2004-01-14)

  -- The document seems to contain a disclaimer for pre-RFC5378 work, and may
     have content which was first submitted before 10 November 2008.  The
     disclaimer is necessary when there are original authors that you have
     been unable to contact, or if some do not wish to grant the BCP78 rights
     to the IETF Trust.  If you are able to get all authors (current and
     original) to grant those rights, you can and should remove the
     disclaimer; otherwise, the disclaimer is needed and you can ignore this
     comment. (See the Legal Provisions document at
     https://trustee.ietf.org/license-info for more information.)

The disclaimer being Section 1.2.

The author of RFC 4119 is Jon Peterson. Have we asked him to grant the rights?
Or am I misunderstanding this issue?
