94	1.  Introduction

96	   Business networks, built on both centralized and decentralized
97	   models, have emerged to manage cross-organization assets and
98	   workflows.  The scope of such workflows and the assets they govern,
99	   as well as the set of participating organizations within a network,
100	   have been quite limited, partly for security, privacy, and
101	   scalability reasons, and partly because organizations have been
102	   reticent to moving large portions of their pre existing workflows to
103	   such networks.  We see this especially in the areas of trade,
104	   finance, supply chain logistics, and property management.  Yet the
105	   workflows managed by these networks are naturally interlinked in the
106	   real world, and therefore cannot afford to remain isolated from each
107	   other technologically, which would diminish the value of their
108	   assets.  At the same time, a network, once built, has institutional
109	   staying power, and it is therefore impractical to assume that they
110	   will expand or merge.  Interoperability is therefore an imperative in
111	   this fragmented business network ecosystem.  This comes in different
112	   flavors, namely the ability to move an asset from one network to
113	   another, interlinking workflows to share asset state with proof of
114	   authenticity from one network to another, and swapping assets in
115	   different networks as part of a business transaction, as listed in
116	   the SAT Architecture Specification [SATA].  The purpose of this
117	   document is to describe prominent examples of these modes that have
118	   been encountered by enterprises and business consortiums and
119	   identified as challenges to be overcome.  In particular, this
120	   document describes scenarios where the Secure Asset Transfer Protocol
121	   (SATP) [SATP] can be directly applied to solve the problem of moving
122	   digital assets across networks, for which no other canonical protocol
123	   exists in the literature.

125	2.  Terminology

127	   The following are some terminology used in the current document.  We
128	   borrow terminology from [NIST] and [ISO] as much as possible,
129	   introducing new terms only when needed:

131	   *  Asset network (system): The network or system where a digital
132	      asset is utilized.

134	   *  Secure Asset Transfer Protocol (SATP): The protocol used to
135	      transfer (move) a digital asset from one network to another using
136	      gateways.

138	   *  Origin network: The current network where the digital asset is
139	      located.

141	   *  Destination network: The network to which a digital asset is to be
142	      transferred.

144	   *  Data sharing: The process, using the Asset Transfer Protocol, by
145	      which one or more units of verifiably authentic data are
146	      communicated from an Origin network to a Destination network,
147	      either voluntarily or upon request.

149	   *  Asset Transfer: A fail-safe process of moving an asset from one
150	      network to another, with the destruction of the asset in the
151	      Origin network and its recreation in the Destination network
152	      occurring as a single atomic action.

154	   *  Asset Exchange: A fail-safe process of exchanging (or swapping)
155	      assets held by a pair of owners, each asset being maintained in a
156	      different network, with the two in-network transfers occurring as
157	      a single atomic action.

159	3.  International Trade and Supply Chains

161	3.1.  Trade Finance and Logistics

163	   There are several real-world examples of consortium networks managing
164	   different aspects of international trade.  Networks like We.Trade
165	   [WET], built on Hyperledger Fabric [HLF], and Marco Polo [MP], built
166	   on R3 Corda [R3C], manage trade finance workflows by connecting
167	   exporters, importers, and financial institutions (primarily banks).
168	   Other networks like TradeLens [TL], built on Hyperledger Fabric,
169	   manage trade shipping and documentation logistics, by connecting
170	   exporters and shipping carriers.  As an example, consider a system of
171	   two networks as illustrated in Figure 1: (a) a trade finance network
172	   managing letters of credit business lifecycles from application to
173	   fulfilment, and (b) a trade logistics network managing shipping
174	   consignment creation and dispatch documents like bills of lading.

200	                               Figure 1

202	   An exporter who belongs to both systems must produce a valid bill of
203	   lading in the trade finance network to enforce a payment from the
204	   buyer to fulfil the terms of the letter of credit.  But this bill,
205	   which serves as evidence of a shipping consignment’s dispatch via a
206	   carrier, lies in the other, i.e., trade logistics, network.  The two
207	   networks must therefore be interoperable in such a way that the
208	   logistics network can share a bill with the finance network along
209	   with independently verifiable proof of authenticity.  Otherwise, the
210	   trade finance network’s workflow must trust that the exporter is
211	   acting in good faith and supplying genuine bills of lading, which
212	   adds insecurity.  This interoperation, which involves sharing of
213	   network data, can be extrapolated to other scenarios involving the
214	   two networks.  The trade logistics network can require an exporter to
215	   produce a valid letter of credit from the trade finance network
216	   before permitting a consignment record creation.  Both these cross-
217	   network data sharing instances are illustrated in Figure 2.

254	   Asset transfers among trade networks: In the preceding example,
255	   letters of credit and bills of lading represent portions of state of
256	   the larger export-import workflow.  But these documents are also
257	   digital assets in their own rights.

259	   A bill of lading can serve as title to the consignment of goods being
260	   shipped, and hence can be traded as a security or used as collateral
261	   against debt obligations in the financial market.  Hence, Step 11 in
262	   Figure 2 may well be embodied by the transfer rather than the sharing
263	   of state of a bill so that it ceases to remain on the Trade Logistics
264	   Network ledger and instead belongs to the Seller’s Bank on the Trade
265	   Finance Network’s ledger.

267	   A letter of credit may also assume the properties of a digital asset
268	   in certain situations.  Consider the case of an importer who wishes
269	   to move their business to a different trade finance network and
270	   maintain their records on that network’s ledger.  We can assume that
271	   the banks and the exporter participate in the second trade finance
272	   network as well, which exists to serve a different clientele.  The
273	   importer needs to be able to move its letter of credit state to the
274	   other network and resume the trade workflow after migration.  This
275	   requires the ability to transfer the letter in the form of a digital
276	   asset from one trade finance network to another.

278	3.2.  Tracking Food Shipments

280	   The use case linking a trade finance network with a trade logistics
281	   network can be augmented by adding a food tracking network like the
282	   IBM Food Trust [IFT] to the mix.  Such a network connects producers,
283	   suppliers, manufactures, and retailers, who participate in food
284	   supply chains.  Purchase orders, like those negotiated between
285	   producers and retailers, and which are illustrated as negotiated
286	   between exporter and importers in Figure 2, are recorded in this
287	   network’s ledger.  For quality control, its business workflow will
288	   track at periodic intervals the state (e.g., temperature and
289	   humidity) of containers carrying, for example, produce from farm to
290	   source port and from destination port to warehouse.  The trade
291	   logistics network handles documentation and dispatch but does not
292	   track the location or condition of a consignment outside of a
293	   carrier’s purview.  Clearly, these networks play complementary roles
294	   in a supply chain.  The logistics network should be able to get the
295	   state and history of a container before dispatch from the food
296	   tracking network, as should the latter from the former after the
297	   carrier has delivered a consignment.  End-to-end supply chain
298	   visibility and effectiveness relies on the interoperability of these
299	   two networks, or to be precise, their ability to share verifiably
300	   authentic data with each other.  Further, such interoperation also
301	   enables the trade finance network to allow the creation of a letter
302	   of credit only after verifying the existence of a valid purchase
303	   order in the food tracking network.  Figure 3 illustrates the links
304	   between these networks.

325	   To complete the picture, we can add a payment network to the mix,
326	   which maintains currency accounts for clients in different countries
327	   and enables cross-border payments, an example being the Stellar
328	   network [STN].  After goods have been dispatched, and optionally
329	   after verification of the delivery and proper condition of a
330	   shipment, payment is due from an importer to an exporter.  The trade
331	   finance network can record a payment obligation on its ledger but it
332	   will rely on the payment network to process and confirm the actual
333	   transfer of funds.  The former shares data about the obligation to
334	   the latter, which shares data about a successful (or otherwise)
335	   payment in return, as illustrated in Figure 4.

360	   Addendum: we can add yet another network to the mix, one that manages
361	   regulatory compliance.  (E.g., proof-of-concept systems have been
362	   built to bring banks and corporations on a single distributed ledger
363	   and smart contract platform to share KYC information in privacy-
364	   preserving ways [BKYC] [SKYC].)  Now issuances of letters of credit
365	   in the trade finance system will be dependent on valid KYC records
366	   being maintained as assets in the regulatory compliance system.

368	4.  Currency and Finance

370	   The emerging paradigm of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and the
371	   emerging application of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) have
372	   opened up a spectrum of scenarios that require management of
373	   financial digital assets across multiple systems, typically built on
374	   distributed ledgers.

376	   DeFi is a “new financial paradigm that leverages distributed ledger
377	   technologies to offer services such as lending, investing, or
378	   exchanging cryptoassets without relying on a traditional centralized
379	   intermediary” [BISDeFi].  Following the Web3 philosophy [Web3],
380	   scoped for the world of finance, DeFi offers architecture and
381	   protocols built on smart contracts deployed on blockchain or other
382	   distributed ledger technology.  It thereby obviates the need for
383	   centralized management and orchestration of financial processes
384	   (e.g., currency transfers, exchanges, securities settlements) by
385	   trusted authorities who can gain undue leverage.

387	   CBDC is a form of tokenized cryptocurrency that various central banks
388	   around the world are experimenting with as the digital equivalent of
389	   traditional central bank-issued money used by banks and other
390	   financial institutions as well as end users for commercial
391	   transactions and settlements.  Central banks possess exclusive
392	   authority to mint and issue money in physical cash form and in the
393	   form of electronic reserves.  They also support commercial bank money
394	   used in retail transactions by banks and other users in their private
395	   capacities.  Central banks have traditionally used their control over
396	   these different forms of money to enforce monetary policy in a way
397	   that promotes financial stability and provides broad access to safe
398	   and efficient payments [BISCBDC].  CBDCs would form a new, or
399	   alternative, type of central bank money, typically (but not always)
400	   built on blockchain or other distributed ledger technology.  They
401	   have recently garnered significant interest in government circles by
402	   promising increased access and inclusion, better resilience, and
403	   increased scale and efficiency of currency transfers, compared to
404	   traditional forms of central bank-issued or central bank-backed
405	   currency.

407	   CBDCs can broadly be classified into “wholesale” and “retail”.
408	   Wholesale CBDC, which facilitates inter-bank and cross-border
409	   settlements, is currency that is available only to banks and other
410	   financial institutions.  Retail CBDC is available to the public and
411	   can be used as a digital form of cash, enabling fast transparent
412	   payments for goods and services at high scale and volume; in effect,
413	   it can be used as a substitute for legacy payment mechanisms.

415	   Different system architectures exist to manage CBDC for banks and end
416	   users, from issuance to transfers to redemptions.  A 2-tier model as
417	   illustrated in Figure 5 has recently gained popularity, where
418	   wholesale CBDC networks manage interactions between central and
419	   commercial banks, and retail CBDC networks manage interactions
420	   between commercial banks and end users.  If we consider the role of
421	   the central bank as the defining characteristic of a system
422	   architecture, this model can be referred to as “indirect”, because
423	   commercial banks mediate claims between the central bank and end
424	   users and also facilitate payments.  Other architectures also exist,
425	   including “direct CBDC”, where the central bank issues CBDC directly
426	   to end users and facilitates payments, and “hybrid CBDC”, which
427	   provides users the facility to make direct claims on the central bank
428	   while allowing intermediaries to facilitate payments [BISRCBDC].

430	4.1.  Currency Transfers

432	   The 2-tier “indirect CBDC” model illustrated in Figure 5 presents
433	   unique interoperability challenges that require protocols for asset
434	   transfers and which SATP is well-suited to handle.  In the higher
435	   tier lie wholesale CBDC networks, bringing together central or
436	   reserve banks and various commercial banks.  Following the DeFi
437	   logic, these networks are typically built on distributed ledger and
438	   smart contract technologies.  Commercial banks hold reserve currency
439	   deposits with the reserve bank, which has the special power to mint
440	   currency and issue CBDC and also enforce regulatory compliance.  In
441	   the lower tier lie retail CBDC networks for commercial banks and
442	   their customers, built on similar technologies, enabling seamless,
443	   efficient, and transparent payments using CBDCs.  A retail CBDC
444	   network may involve a single commercial bank or multiple commercial
445	   banks, depending on the market caps of those banks and their purposes
446	   for joining such a network.

489	                               Figure 5

491	   Here we will encounter scenarios where a given commercial bank
492	   maintains digital currency accounts in a wholesale CBDC network as
493	   well as one or more retail CBDC networks.  To inject liquidity into a
494	   retail CBDC network, this bank will need to transfer currency from
495	   its reserve account in the wholesale CBDC network.  Or it may need to
496	   approve (or at least audit) the transfer of currency from one retail
497	   CBDC network to another bank in another retail CBDC network.  In the
498	   world of decentralized finance, or DeFi for short, currency cannot
499	   afford to remain siloed in any single CBDC network.  Hence, these
500	   networks must be interoperable in order to facilitate secure
501	   transfers of currency among themselves, as illustrated in Figure 5.

503	   We can identify two specific instances of currency transfer across
504	   networks in this example: one from a wholesale CBDC network to a
505	   retail CBDC network, and another from one retail CBDC network to
506	   another.  Since currency in tokenized form is a digital asset, these
507	   scenarios require the direct application of a secure protocol for
508	   asset transfer.  SATP [SATP] fits the bill, is agnostic of the types
509	   of distributed ledger technologies on which the respective networks
510	   are built, and simply requires the networks to use SATP gateways.
511	   This is not just a theoretical proposition; a candidate design for a
512	   bridge between Hyperledger Fabric [HLF] and Hyperledger Besu [HLB]
513	   networks using SATP and the Hyperledger Cacti interoperability
514	   platform [HLC] has been proposed by distributed ledger researchers
515	   [Aug23].

517	4.2.  Multi-CBDC Economy

519	   Several governments, banks and financial communities have explored
520	   the use of a shared ledger containing multiple CBDCs as way to
521	   potentially obtain an economy of scale in the development and
522	   maintenance of their own respective CBDCs.  Such a Multi-CBDC
523	   approach has the potential benefit to improve cross-border payments
524	   and protect monetary sovereignty, without necessarily becoming a
525	   monetary union [BISMCBDC].

527	   However, even within a Multi-CBDC configuration, there must be a
528	   mechanism to interconnect each respective national (sovereign) bank
529	   network with the shared Multi-CBDC network.  Gateways appear to be an
530	   attractive means to permit the transfer of a CBDC from one national
531	   network/ledger into the shared Multi-CBDC ledger, and vice versa.
532	   One major requirement is the assurance that consistency is maintained
533	   between the CBDC counts on the national network with that on the
534	   Multi-CBDC network (i.e. no counterfeiting; no double-spend).

536	   With or without a Multi-CBDC ledger, the existence of different
537	   national networks managing different wholesale CBDC assets will
538	   necessitate inter-network transfers for cross-border payments and
539	   settlements [BISCBP] [WBGCBP] [PUbin].  Whether directly between two
540	   wholesale CBDC networks or between a wholesale CBDC network and the
541	   Multi-CBDC network, transfer of currency assets is a problem for
542	   which SATP appears to be the most suitable solution.

544	4.3.  Delivery vs Payment (DvP) of Securities

546	   In Decentralized Finance, or DeFi for short, investors and financial
547	   institutions will form networks to manage the creation and purchase
548	   of securities.  As a simple example, we can consider a network
549	   consisting of the Treasury, which issues bonds, and commercial banks,
550	   which purchase and trade bonds.  We can also consider a payment
551	   network of the kind we saw in Section 3.3 (or a retail CBDC network
552	   of the kind we saw in Section 4.1), which allows CBDC transfers
553	   between commercial banks’ accounts.  In the securities network, banks
554	   may wish to transfer bonds to each other but only in exchange for
555	   compensation.  But such compensation can be made only on a payment
556	   network where the two maintain currency accounts (e.g., in CBDC).
557	   Therefore, the securities and payment networks must be able to
558	   interoperate in such a way that two banks can carry out a delivery-
559	   vs-payment transaction spanning these two independent networks.  Such
560	   a transaction must be atomic, i.e., either both bond and CBDC tokens
561	   get transferred in their respective networks or neither gets

603	   In a variation of this example, the two commercial banks may hold
604	   CBDC accounts in two different Payment Networks.  In that case,
605	   fulfilment of the DvP would require transfer of CBDC from one network
606	   to another.  An instance of SATP between gateways representing those
607	   two networks would handle that problem.

609	4.4.  Stock Options Contract Fulfilment

611	   Stock options are financial instruments that allow holders to buy or
612	   sell stock at predetermined prices until specific expiration dates
613	   [StOpt].  Exercising an option, i.e., buying or selling a stock by
614	   paying a “strike price”, involves a more complex cross-network
615	   financial transaction than the securities DvP use case.  Option
616	   contracts can be managed and enforced in a specific business network
617	   (which we can label as a “stock network”) to which entities like an
618	   Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), stock exchanges (e.g., the
619	   Chicago Board Options Exchange), and brokerage firms, belong.  The
620	   OCC is the issuer and guarantor for all options and futures contracts
621	   traded on U.S. exchanges [OCC].  It provides secured back-end
622	   clearing services, while exchanges provide front-end trading markets.
623	   Transfer and settlement of payments, just like in the DvP scenario,
624	   will typically occur in a dedicated payment network in which buyers
625	   and sellers of stock have currency accounts.  Options contract
626	   fulfilment requires the stock and payment networks to work in
627	   concert, and hence need SATP to coordinate transactions across them.

629	   Figure 7 illustrates a simplified flow for the exercising of a “call”
630	   option, where a buyer acquires stock from a seller by paying it a
631	   strike price.  First, the buyer informs its brokerage, which then
632	   notifies its exchange about the buyer's intent to exercise the
633	   option.  The exchange in turn notifies the OCC in the Stock Network.
634	   (All these notifications typically occur via a smart contract).
635	   Steps 1-2 illustrate these notifications.  The OCC then verifies the
636	   contract’s validity and the buyer’s right to exercise the option.  If
637	   this is successful, the OCC triggers a payment request to the buyer
638	   through a contract-to-contract communication from the Stock Network
639	   to the Payment Network (step 3).  (Alternatively, the buyer may
640	   trigger a payment request in the Payment Network, which then requests
641	   the Stock Network for proof of the contract’s validity from the OCC
642	   before approving the payment.)  The buyer then pays the strike price
643	   to the seller (step 4).  The payment receipt is now sent to the Stock
644	   Network for the OCC’s verification (or alternatively, the buyer can
645	   request the OCC to fetch and verify the receipt from the Payment
646	   Network) and fulfilment of the contract (step 5).  The OCC, via the
647	   exchange, requests the brokerage to transfer stock from the seller’s
648	   to the buyer’s account (steps 6-7).

650	   This cross-network transactions require SATP using gateways, either
651	   to communicate information of a contract’s validity (step 3) or a
652	   payment receipt (step 5) with authenticity proof (i.e., data
653	   sharing), or by ensuring that strike price payment (step 4) and
654	   contract fulfilment (step 6-7) occur atomically as an exchange using
655	   a coordinated set of commitments.

696	5.  Decentralized Commerce: Payments for Goods and Services

698	   In the emerging Web3 world, undergirded by blockchain and DLT, goods
699	   and services are increasingly available on decentralized networks,
700	   either as purely digital objects or proxies of physical objects.  The
701	   networks typically manage these assets in the form of non-fungible
702	   tokens (NFTs) using smart contracts and decentralized applications
703	   (DApps for short).  DeFi in a Web3 ecosystem can create thriving
704	   online marketplaces where goods and services can be bought and sold
705	   across network boundaries if those networks are interoperable (i.e.,
706	   assets and data can be moved or managed seamlessly across networks).
707	   SATP is a necessary requirement to enable and secure such a
708	   decentralized form of commerce.

710	5.1.  Transferal of Digital Art and Payments across National Borders

712	   There is currently growing interest within many artist communities of
713	   developing and selling digital-only artwork, in which the artwork
714	   consists of a file in a well-known (e.g., JPEG, MPEG) format that is
715	   created by an artist.  The artists seek to sell copies of the
716	   digital-only artwork on the global marketplace, allowing anyone in
717	   the world to purchase a copy and consume (e.g., display offline) the
718	   artwork at the buyer’s discretion.  Currently, the most popular
719	   technological vehicle to achieve this goal is through the
720	   tokenization of the copies of the artwork coupled with digital
721	   encryption/signature technologies to transfer control (and thereby
722	   legal ownership) of the digital-only artwork to the buyer.

724	   Although there are a number of technical and legal challenges (e.g.,
725	   copyright enforcement) to completing such a sale, one key issue
726	   pertains to the sale and payment for digital-only artwork across
727	   national borders.  Many nations enforce taxation upon the sale of any
728	   asset, including that of artwork generally both domestically and
729	   internationally.  Thus, when the control/ownership of a tokenized
730	   digital-only artwork is transferred to a new owner in a foreign
731	   nation and payment is received, taxation must be obtained at the
732	   point-of-sale (which could be an online platform) and proof of
733	   delivery must be traceable to ensure that no taxation-avoidance
734	   occurs.  A secure asset transfer protocol between systems that can be
735	   built on distributed or shared ledgers via gateways with designated
736	   legal authority is necessary to enforce governmental regulations and
737	   provide accountability.

739	5.2.  Payment for Streaming Services

741	   Streaming services like Netflix and IPTV can tap into the
742	   cryptocurrency and DeFi user markets by offering content on
743	   distributed ledger networks using smart contracts.  Instead of
744	   monthly subscriptions, they can offer pay-as-you-go streaming of
745	   arbitrarily low amounts to large numbers of users on such networks.
746	   Content transfer can be backed by NFTs, which users can redeem on any
747	   video or audio playback application.  Because here already exist
748	   several payment networks for unregulated (e.g., Bitcoin) and
749	   regulated (e.g., CBDC) currencies, the content networks are likely to
750	   remain independent and not involve any monetary transactions on their
751	   own ledgers, as that would create safety and regulatory issues.
752	   Content transfer in a content network can be backed by a
753	   corresponding payment in a payment network if there is a facility to
754	   transfer payment receipts from the latter to the former.  This can be
755	   fulfilled through the data sharing mode of SATP, whereby knowledge of
756	   payment along with authenticity proof can be communicated across
757	   networks.  Alternatively, an atomic swap of the content and the
758	   payment can occur across both networks using the asset exchange mode
759	   of SATP.

761	   In a related example, if users wish to obtain content that is not
762	   available currently with the streaming service provider, that
763	   provider may seek and purchase that content from another distributer
764	   that is offering it on a different content network.  The copyright to
765	   that content can be backed by NFTs and the secure transfer of those
766	   NFTs from one network to another will require SATP.

768	   Though these examples show what is possible, ongoing initiatives in
769	   Europe and China are aimed at facilitating data and asset transfers.
770	   Since 2022, China has issued a series of policies and guidelines to
771	   promote the development of a nationwide data market that supports
772	   data elements' assetization, capitalization, and circulation
773	   [CNMeas].  A multi-layered national data infrastructure is slated be
774	   built by the end of 2029 to support transaction, transmission, and
775	   utilization, of data; telecom operators like China Mobile and China
776	   Unicom are building large- scale networks to enable data transmission
777	   [CNDatInf].  Design and implementation of this infrastructure will be
778	   guided by the newly established National Data Standardization
779	   Technical Committee (TC609), which will coordinate with existing data
780	   circulation standards organizations like ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 32 and ISO/
781	   IEC JTC 1/SC 42, and reuse existing standards.

783	   In Europe, several projects like Gaia-X [GaiaX] and Catena-X
784	   [CatenaX] aim to create secure, decentralized, and interoperable data
785	   infrastructures.  Catena-X specifically targets data exchanges in
786	   automotive industry operations while Gaia-X is a more generic, EU-
787	   wide data infrastructure.  The International Data Spaces Association
788	   (IDSA) produces several ISO standards like ISO/IEC AWI 20151 and ISO/
789	   IEC 23751:2022 for exchanges across data spaces [IDSA].  The IDSA
790	   also partners with the Eclipse Foundation to implement open-source
791	   solutions [EclDS] and jointly develop the Dataspace Protocol (DSP),
792	   using which data usage policies, usage contracts, and schemas can be
793	   negotiated (in the so-called "control plane") between two data-
794	   exchange gateway peers [DSP].  The actual post-negotiation data
795	   transfer (in the so-called "data plane") is out of scope of DSP, and
796	   here SATP can fill the gap.

798	6.  Trustworthy DNS Resource Record Migrations using an Augmented EPP

800	   We have seen several examples where SATP is indispensable for
801	   enabling cross-network asset and data transfer and transaction
802	   settlement.  But SATP can also be used to augment an existing
803	   protocol by making it more secure, trustworthy, and efficient rather
804	   than creating an altogether new feature that preexisting technology
805	   was unable to provide.  Conventional Internet architecture offers
806	   scope for such augmentation.  Though highly decentralized, the
807	   Internet consists of nodes (or actors) that play critical roles in
808	   various protocols.  Such protocols would benefit if the actions of
809	   these actors can be recorded and tracked on blockchain or other
810	   decentralized ledger networks.  (It must be noted that the
811	   performance implications of these augmentations ought to be studied
812	   before firm recommendations are made.)

814	   We consider the DNS architecture [RFC1034] [RFC1035], where multiple
815	   registries and registrars may co-exist, managing DNS records for
816	   owners (registrants).  For example, Verisign [VSign] acts as a TLD
817	   (top-level domain) registry for the “.com” namespace, and GoDaddy
818	   [GoDaddy] and Squarespace [SSpace] are registrars that can issue and
819	   sell SLDs (second- level domains) to customers (say Alice and Bob).
820	   The Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) allows registrars to
821	   communicate with registries for resource record updates, including
822	   changes in domain ownership [RFC5730].  Consider a scenario in which
823	   Alice, who owns an SLD (say alice.com) issued by GoDaddy, wishes to
824	   transfer that SLD to Squarespace.  She can submit a request to
825	   Squarespace for this purpose, following which the respective
826	   registrars (GoDaddy and Squarespace) can communicate with the
827	   registry (Verisign) using EPP to transfer the SLD between themselves.
828	   Squarespace will then reissue the domain to Alice.  In a related
829	   scenario, Alice can transfer (or sell) her GoDaddy-issued domain to
830	   Bob, who uses Squarespace as a registrant.

832	   Though EPP facilitates these resource updates and transfers, and
833	   reputed registrars offer customers these features in a usable manner,
834	   we can see that such scenarios face safety issues as they require
835	   trust and proper coordination among the participants.  These issues
836	   can be mitigated by distributed ledger networks, smart contracts, and
837	   NFTs, which collectively provide a platform for safe and transparent
838	   DNS resource transfers with easy detection of non-compliance.

840	   In such a scheme, domains (or domain names) can be monetized as NFTs
841	   or digital assets, e.g., in the form of ERC-721 [ERC721] tokens, a
842	   popular NFT standard in the Ethereum ecosystem [Ethereum].  The
843	   creation of a domain is represented by minting of an NFT and the
844	   deletion of a domain by the burning of the NFT using smart contracts
845	   whose transactions are tracked on a distributed ledger maintained by
846	   a network of entities.  Registrants Alice and Bob also participate in
847	   the smart contracts and hold wallet identities, allowing them to
848	   trade assets by submitting transactions to the ledger.  Registrants,
849	   registrars, and registries can engage in commercial transactions
850	   using contracts governing tokenized (and monetized) domains for the
851	   purposes of issuing and transferring domains (among owners and
852	   registrars).  This provides more safety where registrars are not
853	   reputed, and allows new registrar services to emerge and build
854	   reputations.  It also enables customers like Alice and Bob to sell
855	   domains to each other safely and seamlessly.

857	   SATP is crucial to enabling this scheme where registrars belong to,
858	   and issue, NFT-backed domains in different ledgers maintained by
859	   different networks.  Ensuring that tokens are securely and atomically
860	   transferred between the ledgers will be a necessary prerequisite for
861	   an EPP resource record update operation.  Further, non-compliance, or
862	   non-fulfilment of EPP, by either registrar, can be easily detected by
863	   examining the SATP logs from the respective networks’ gateways,
864	   thereby safeguarding the process.  In future, reputed registrars may
865	   require their counterparties to comply with SATP-based transfers
866	   across ledgers as a prerequisite to engaging in a domain transfer
867	   with them.

869	   This scenario additionally illustrates an example of what typically
870	   occurs in Stage 0 of a SATP instance [SATP], which is where
871	   negotiation and agreement-building occurs between gateways.  EPP
872	   instances among registrars and registries will occur in this stage,
873	   both prior to the start of an SATP instance and after its conclusion.
874	   EPP will produce the transaction context the gateways need to
875	   transfer an asset (in this case, a tokenized domain) using SATP.
876	   Many other applications of SATP for asset transfers may similarly
877	   augment or bolster pre-existing business workflows, which (like EPP
878	   here) will produce transactions contexts for SATP instances.

880	7.  Interoperation Protocol Considerations

882	   The use cases provided as examples serve to illustrate instances of
883	   general phenomena that the Secure Asset Transfer Protocol [SATP],
884	   with a limited number of variations, is designed to handle.  The data
885	   sharing examples in Section 3 can be extrapolated to any kinds of
886	   data that need to be shared between networks running arbitrary
887	   workflows.  The asset transfer example in Section 4.1 and the asset
888	   exchange example in Section 4.3 similarly can be extrapolated to any
889	   kinds of digital assets lying within any kind of network.
890	   Considerations for the interoperability protocol, or SATP, can
891	   therefore be limited to standard distributed systems issues like
892	   integrity, fault tolerance, and liveness, while completely
893	   disregarding the nature of the assets, networks, and workflows, which
894	   can all remain opaque to the protocol.
