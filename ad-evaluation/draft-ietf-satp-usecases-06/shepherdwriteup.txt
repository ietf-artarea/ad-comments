# SATP-usecases Shepherd Write-Up

As required by [<a href="/doc/rfc4858/">RFC 4858</a>](<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4858.txt">https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4858.txt</a>) and
requested by the SATP WG, this is the shepherd write-up of SATP-usecases
document using the most current template I found at
[here](<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/shepherdwriteup-template/individual">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/shepherdwriteup-template/individual</a>).

## Document History

1. Does the working group (WG) consensus represent the strong concurrence of a
few individuals, with others being silent, or did it reach broad agreement?

This document has been discussed in nearly all SATP sessions at past IETF
meetings. On February 4, 2025, the chairs called on the working group to
review the document and submit feedback. For the SATP-architecture document,
the following responses were received:

* 2 reviews with suggested changes (Hadarker and Willman)
* 23 reviews with explicit support.

Before that, there are
[9](<a href="https://github.com/ietf-satp/draft-ietf-satp-usecases/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed">https://github.com/ietf-satp/draft-ietf-satp-usecases/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed</a>)
closed PRs related to reviews and fixes and
[1](<a href="https://github.com/ietf-satp/draft-ietf-satp-usecases/issues/1">https://github.com/ietf-satp/draft-ietf-satp-usecases/issues/1</a>) closed
issue where several points were discussed and fixed.

2. Was there controversy about particular points, or were there decisions where
the consensus was particularly rough?

No. The consensus within the working group on this document was reached
without any resolved comment.

3. Has anyone threatened an appeal or otherwise indicated extreme discontent? If
so, please summarize the areas of conflict in separate email messages to the
responsible Area Director. (It should be in a separate email because this
questionnaire is publicly available.)

None noticed.

4. For protocol documents, are there existing implementations of the contents of
the document? Have a significant number of potential implementers indicated
plans to implement? Are any existing implementations reported somewhere,
either in the document itself (as <a href="/doc/rfc7942/">RFC 7942</a> recommends) or elsewhere
(where)?

This is not a protocol document, but one of the document authors is actively
participating Hyperledger Cacti project as an open source. In addition,
there were several reports of the SATP implementations such as Quant's
distributed ledgers, South Korea's CBDC pilot system.

## Additional Reviews

5. Do the contents of this document closely interact with technologies in other
IETF working groups or external organizations, and would it therefore benefit
from their review? Have those reviews occurred? If yes, describe which
reviews took place.

There is no known review from other WGs, but as an external organization -
the Hyperledger Cacti project - members have provided several comments on
actual use cases that have been discussed in the Hyperledger Cacti regular
online meetings.

6. Describe how the document meets any required formal expert review criteria,
such as the MIB Doctor, YANG Doctor, media type, and URI type reviews.

SATP WG mambers working within various domains have provided several use
cases over the world, so it seems no more required formal expert review in
terms of the use cases contents.

7. If the document contains a YANG module, has the final version of the module
been checked with any of the recommended validation tools for syntax and
formatting validation? If there are any resulting errors or warnings, what is
the justification for not fixing them at this time? Does the YANG module
comply with the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) as specified
in <a href="/doc/rfc8342/">RFC 8342</a>?

The document does not contain a YANG module.

8. Describe reviews and automated checks performed to validate sections of the
final version of the document written in a formal language, such as XML code,
BNF rules, MIB definitions, CBOR's CDDL, etc.

According to
<a href="https://author-tools.ietf.org/api/idnits?url=https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-satp-usecases-06.txt">https://author-tools.ietf.org/api/idnits?url=https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-satp-usecases-06.txt</a>
(The latest version: 06), there were two errors on the validation result. It
will be fixed soon.

## Document Shepherd Checks

9. Based on the shepherd's review of the document, is it their opinion that this
document is needed, clearly written, complete, correctly designed, and ready
to be handed off to the responsible Area Director?

In [a github issue
link](<a href="https://github.com/ietf-satp/draft-ietf-satp-usecases/issues/1">https://github.com/ietf-satp/draft-ietf-satp-usecases/issues/1</a>), the
shepherd and authors have discussed in-depth reviews on the document. The
shephered confirm that it is ready to be handed off to the responsible Area
Director now.

10. Several IETF Areas have assembled lists of common issues that their
reviewers encounter. For which areas have such issues been identified
and addressed? For which does this still need to happen in subsequent
reviews?

There seemed no other reated IETF Areas that consider the blockchain
interoperability domain in terms of use cases.

11. What type of RFC publication is being requested on the IETF stream (Best
Current Practice, Proposed Standard, Internet Standard,
Informational, Experimental or Historic)? Why is this the proper type
of RFC? Do all Datatracker state attributes correctly reflect this intent?

Informational. This is an use cases document.

12. Have reasonable efforts been made to remind all authors of the intellectual
property rights (IPR) disclosure obligations described in <a href="/doc/bcp79/">BCP 79</a>? To
the best of your knowledge, have all required disclosures been filed? If
not, explain why. If yes, summarize any relevant discussion, including links
to publicly-available messages when applicable.

No. The proposed use cases are common contents, so there is no any risk of
IPR.

13. Has each author, editor, and contributor shown their willingness to be
listed as such? If the total number of authors and editors on the front page
is greater than five, please provide a justification.

No issue discovered. The total number of authors and editors is three.

14. Document any remaining I-D nits in this document. Simply running the idnits
tool is not enough; please review the "Content Guidelines" on
<a href="http://authors.ietf.org">authors.ietf.org</a>. (Also note that the current idnits tool generates
some incorrect warnings; a rewrite is underway.)

\*\* The document seems to lack a Security Considerations section.

\*\* There are 81 instances of too long lines in the document, the longest
one being 4 characters in excess of 72.

It is note mentioning the document references have a lot of nits, undefined
cites, unused cites, incorrect cites... For page conciseness, I leave the
link
[here](<a href="https://author-tools.ietf.org/api/idnits?url=https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-satp-usecases-06.txt">https://author-tools.ietf.org/api/idnits?url=https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-satp-usecases-06.txt</a>).

15. Should any informative references be normative or vice-versa? See the IESG
Statement on Normative and Informative References.

None.

16. List any normative references that are not freely available to anyone. Did
the community have sufficient access to review any such normative
references?

Thers is no unavailable reference.

17. Are there any normative downward references (see <a href="/doc/rfc3967/">RFC 3967</a> and BCP 1) that
are not already listed in the DOWNREF registry? If so, list them.

No such cases

18. Are there normative references to documents that are not ready to be
submitted to the IESG for publication or are otherwise in an unclear state?
If so, what is the plan for their completion?

The only normative IETF references are SATP-CORE and SATP-Archi which are
under reviews of the IESG for publication.

19. Will publication of this document change the status of any existing RFCs? If
so, does the Datatracker metadata correctly reflect this and are those RFCs
listed on the title page, in the abstract, and discussed in the
introduction? If not, explain why and point to the part of the document
where the relationship of this document to these other RFCs is discussed.

No.

20. Describe the document shepherd's review of the IANA considerations section,
especially with regard to its consistency with the body of the document.
Confirm that all aspects of the document requiring IANA assignments are
associated with the appropriate reservations in IANA registries. Confirm
that any referenced IANA registries have been clearly identified. Confirm
that each newly created IANA registry specifies its initial contents,
allocations procedures, and a reasonable name (see <a href="/doc/rfc8126/">RFC 8126</a>).

In the use cases document, the IANA considerations are not required.

21. List any new IANA registries that require Designated Expert Review for
future allocations. Are the instructions to the Designated Expert clear?
Please include suggestions of designated experts, if appropriate.

In the use cases document, any new IANA registry is not required.
